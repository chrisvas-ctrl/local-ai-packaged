### How do I set up sleep schedule? 
Sleep Schedule can be used to conserve power when Starlink isn't being used. Any user connected to the local Starlink WiFi network can adjust the Sleep Schedule setting. To enable Sleep Schedule:
  1. Open the Starlink app and navigate to Settings. Click "Starlink" then "Sleep Schedule".
  2. Switch on "Enable sleep schedule".
  3. Drag the handles on the clock to specify when Starlink should sleep.
  4. Click save.


During this sleep period, Starlink will not provide internet service or melt snow, and cannot be managed remotely.
To disable Sleep Schedule, navigate to Settings, click "Starlink" then "Sleep Schedule". Switch off "Enable sleep schedule", and Save.
**Note: Accumulated snow may take several hours to melt after Starlink wakes up, and you may need to clear off snow to resume service.**
