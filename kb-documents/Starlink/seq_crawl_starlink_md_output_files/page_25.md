### Why can't I change my service plan?
Residential and Business customers on specific service plans may have associated policies that prevent them from changing to a different service plan. These policies may be applicable for the duration of the time on these service plans.
The specific service plans include:
**Starlink Rental option:**
  * Residential customers on the Starlink Rental option may not be permitted to change their service plan.


**Starlink Financing/Installments option:**
  * Customers on the Starlink Financing/Installments option may not be permitted to change their service plan for the entire duration of the financing term.


**Government Subsidy Programs:**
  * Starlink has partnered with different government entities to offer internet connectivity at a discounted rate for eligible households. Customers on these discounted service plans may not be permitted to change their service plan.


**Disaster Relief:**
  * Customers on any Disaster Relief service plan may not be permitted to change their service plan.


**12-Month Commitment option:**
  * Customers on the 12-month Residential plan must reach out to Customer Support in order to change their service plan and will be charged a Change Fee, pro-rated for the month of their service plan change.


​
**Additional limitations:**
  * Customers whose accounts have been suspended due to billing non-payment may not be able to change their service plan
  * Customers in "Sold Out" regions, that do not have other service plans available to them, may not be able to change their service plan
