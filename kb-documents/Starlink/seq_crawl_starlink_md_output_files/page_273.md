### Where should I install my Starlink?
Your Starlink needs a clear view of the sky so it can stay connected with satellites as they move overhead. Objects that obstruct the connection between your Starlink and the satellite, such as a tree branch, pole, or roof, will cause service interruptions. Click [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/videos/2>) for guidance on using the Starlink App ([iOS](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/apps.apple.com/us/app/starlink/id1537177988>), [Android](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starlink.mobile>)) to check for obstructions and find the install location that will deliver the best service.
Many customers find that a permanent mount in an elevated location, like a roof, pole, or wall, provides the best installation and service. Click [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/topic?category=6&category=85&category=72>) to learn how to permanently install Starlink, which is recommended for best performance, cable protection and long-term reliability. You will also find resources such as Setup Guides, Accessory Guides, Specs Guides and Installation videos. Additional mounts and accessories are available for purchase on the [Starlink Shop](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.com/shop/>) once your Starlink Kit is ready to ship.
