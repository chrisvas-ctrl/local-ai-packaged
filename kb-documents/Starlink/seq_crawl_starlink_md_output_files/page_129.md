### Part of my order did not arrive yet. What do I do?
Items ship out as soon as they are ready and can expect each item to ship separately.
If you have multiple items in your order, one item will not delay the others.
For orders marked as 'delivered' but have not arrived yet, [click here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=126ee6a3-8c3f-2014-3283-4c678c99ed0b>) for additional guidance.
