### How do I change my WiFi network name (SSID) and password?
To change your WiFi network name or WiFi password from the Starlink App: 
  1. Connect to your Starlink WiFi network.
  2. Sign into your Starlink Account.
  3. Go to Settings. 
  4. Under Router configuration, select WiFi network you wish to change. 
  5. Adjust the WiFi network name and/or password and then click "Save".
  6. Any connected devices will be disconnected. Reconnect to your wireless network using your new credentials.


For security, after your password has been set, it will not be shown again. If you forget your WiFi password, [factory reset](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/d68ed178-4d54-b486-b7d8-2a6273917632>) your Starlink router to assign a new WiFi network name and password.
​
**Important Notes:**
  * A WiFi network name is also called a SSID. A WiFi password can be referred to as a network security key, WPA key or WPA/WPA2 passphrase.
  * Only give your WiFi password out to people you trust. The WiFi network name must contain 4 to 32 characters, numbers, or spaces. The WiFi password must contain 8 to 32 characters, numbers, spaces, or symbols.
  * Creating a WiFi name and password is optional, however we recommend securing your WiFi network. Your Starlink WiFi network is not password protected until you set the password.


​
**Brazil Only:** In order to comply with the law in Brazil, there has been a recent change made to what is required for setting up your WiFi password. Below are the requirements:
  * Is 8 to 32 characters long
  * Contain at least one upper case character
  * Contain at least one lower case character
  * Contain at least one number
  * Contain at least one special character
    * Example: "1StrongPa$sword"
