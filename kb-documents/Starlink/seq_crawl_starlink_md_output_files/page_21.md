### How do I change my service address?
The following instructions do not apply to users with Roam and Maritime service plans.
**How to Change Your Service Address on Desktop:**
  1. Log into your Starlink [account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>).
  2. Go to the "Your Starlink," section
  3. Click "Edit" under the "Service Location" box
  4. Enter the new service address
  5. Save your changes


**How to Change Your Service Address on the Starlink App:**
  1. Open the Starlink app.
  2. Tap the person icon.
  3. Select "Manage Subscription."
  4. Tap "Service Location."
  5. Choose to set the address to your current location or manually enter a new address.
  6. Click "Set Service Address."
  7. Your service address is now updated.


**Important Notes:**
  * Changing your service address may prevent you from returning to your original address. Once updated, service at your previous address will be disconnected. Service is only guaranteed at the service address on your account. Moving Starlink outside of its assigned area may result in no internet or degraded service.
  * US Residential service plan costs may vary based on the service location. If a US or Canada customer who received a "Regional Savings" updates their service address to a region not eligible for the savings, they will be billed the amount of the original savings.


**Change Unsuccessful:**
  * If the service address change was unsuccessful, the area might be at capacity or not active for service yet. View Starlink's service availability map at [starlink.com/map](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/map>). Alternatively, consider changing your service plan to Roam for use away from your address. Learn how to change your service plan [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=903869c7-4eff-bf52-76c8-2af222799734>).
  * If you are performing this action on the app, and recieved an error, this may mean your app version is outdated. Make sure you have updated to the latest version of the app, or try again in your account on Starlink.com in a browser.


**Changing Country:**
  * Your new service address cannot be in a different country than the one used during initial sign-up.
  * For use away from your address, consider changing your service plan. Learn how to change your service plan [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=903869c7-4eff-bf52-76c8-2af222799734>).
  * For a permanent move to a different country, see the transfer requirements [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=f3cad923-ed28-f957-365c-787f8fe2e4a2>).
