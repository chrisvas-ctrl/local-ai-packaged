  * [For aircraft flying at any speed:](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<#for-aircraft-flying-at-any-speed>)


To purchase a Starlink Mini, visit this [page](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<http:/www.starlink.com/roam>), select a subscription, and follow the steps below to create your account.
After finalizing your order at Starlink.com and creating your account, you can upgrade your Roam service line based on your aircraft maximum speed.
**Note: All speeds mentioned below are understood as ground speed.**
#### For aircraft flying at <478KTS:
  1. On the ‘Home’ tab, find your service line and click “Manage” 
  2. Click on “Change Service Plan” 
  3. Select one of the General Aviation plans:


  * Local Priority for ground speeds <300kts (within the same country)
  * Global Priority for ground speeds <478kts (worldwide access)


​
#### For aircraft flying at any speed:
Fill in all required fields and in the details section of the ticket, request an upgrade of your service line to one of the two Business Aviation plans:

​
**Upgrading service to any of the Business Aviation service plans requires the user to sign the Starlink Business Service Terms at time of upgrade request. The new aviation-compatible subscription will be active for use only after the request has been completed and the new terms have been signed. Make sure to submit the support ticket before you’re ready to fly and monitor your ticket for responses to prevent delay.**
