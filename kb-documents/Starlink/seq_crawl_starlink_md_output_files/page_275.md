### What are the differences between the Starlink Standard and the Starlink Standard Actuated Kits?
Both the Standard Kit and Standard Actuated Kit provide the same reliable, high-speed internet you can expect from Starlink. Both of these Standard hardware versions are compatible with the same service plans and installation use cases. They are both designed to be mounted as your Residential or Business Starlink, or can be packed up and taken with you on the go as a Roam Starlink.

---|---  
![Starlink Standard](https://www.starlink.com/public-files/Starlink_Standard_Hero_500x500.png) | ![Starlink_V2_Terminal](https://www.starlink.com/public-files/Starlink_Rectangular_500x500.png)  
[Setup Guide](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=412a70ca-0d9a-813e-b18f-75c36b84ec06>) | [Setup Guide](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=1d56f921-5ae1-7c3d-1fba-93adeb46da98>)  
The differences are outlined below.
**First Time Setup Process:**
Both Starlinks are electronic phased array antennas, meaning they can track the signal from satellites overhead without the need to physically move. Once Starlink is properly set up with no obstructions and proper alignment, you will not be required to adjust it again in the future. The Standard Kit is first set up by the user manually adjusting the Starlink with guidance from the Alignment Tool in the Starlink App. The Standard Actuated Kit initial set up uses a built-in motor for motorized self-orientation.
**Included Equipment:**
**Starlink:** Standard has a slightly larger surface area than Standard Actuated, and the profile of the Standard Actuated is thicker due to the built-in motors and mast.
**Router:** The Standard Kit comes with the Gen 3 WiFi Router, whereas the Standard Actuated kit comes with the Gen 2 WiFi Router. You can compare specs of each router [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=f7105c55-8d50-ac74-fb47-210edc350f85>).
**Mount:** Both include a temporary mounting base for quick setup or portable use, or can be drilled into a flat surface for permanent installation. Each have additional compatible mounts available on the Starlink shop. Standard comes with a built-in kickstand, which can flip out for quick deployment, fold away for storage, or drill into a flat surface. Standard Actuated comes attached to a mast that connects to an x-shaped base.
**Cables:** Both include a Starlink cable length of 50 ft, with longer cable options on the shop, specific to each kit.
**Power Supply":** The Standard power supply stands alone as a separate item, whereas the Standard Actuated power supply is integrated into the router.
