### Do you offer role based access control? 
Starlink now provides role-based access control into the Starlink.com website (coming soon to Starlink mobile app). Role-based access control (RBAC) gives you more control of who within your account has access to view information and make changes. We have separated the different functions within Starlink.com into separate roles. Each role has an edit and read-only option (except Admin), and roles can be combined to tailor to your specific needs.
For a business customer, role-based access control is an essential security feature so that different teams within your organization can seamlessly interact while “staying in their lane”. For a residential customer, this could enable you to give a tenant or roommate the ability to reboot their terminal or start a support ticket without them having access to buy another Starlink kit, or accessories.
The roles available will be:
  * **Admin:** Full functionality of Starlink.com plus the ability to edit roles; each account must have at least 1 admin
  * **Billing:** Ability to make changes on billing and shop tabs (make payments, update payment information, view invoices and account balance, order via Starlink shop)
    * Billing read only: Ability to view billing and shop tabs but not make changes
  * **Technical:** Ability to make changes on dashboard and service line pages (troubleshoot and take actions on your hardware & service: manage service lines, take actions on the terminal and router including reboot, stow, configure your Starlink, update IP policy, add/remove starlink, add service line, and change service plan)
    * Technical read only: Ability to view dashboard and service line pages but not make changes
  * **Support:** All users will have access to the FAQs, but a support role will be required to create, view, and respond to support tickets
    * Support read only: view existing support tickets
  * **User Management:** Add, delete, and view users and edit the role(s) assigned to users
    * User Management read only: view users and roles


Below are a few examples of how these roles may be used:
  * A technician troubleshooting in the field may have technical and support roles.
  * The leader for a team of technicians may have technical, support, and user management so they can add new team members to the system. If the lead also needs the ability to order via the shop, they would be better suited by the admin role.
  * An accounting team member may have Billing and Support roles.


What is not included in this initial roll-out of role-based access control?
  * **Starlink App:** Roles will not affect functionality in the Starlink app in the initial release because the Starlink app has separate security measures that have already been built in.
  * **API access:** Access to the Starlink APIs is not tied to a specific role, but enterprise accounts can still reach out about API access to Starlink support or to their account manager, if applicable.
