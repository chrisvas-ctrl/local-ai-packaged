### What is the rent Starlink option?
Customers in select markets can rent Starlink for a one-time activation price and a monthly hardware rental price. Renting offers a flexible option to get started with Starlink internet for customers in select countries. Starlink kits may only be rented for Standard (Residential) or Priority (Business) service plans. Starlink rentals are not currently available for Land Mobility or Maritime services. 
  * Note: There is a 1 kit rental limit per Standard (Residential) account.


To order or check the price details per country follow the steps below:
  1. Navigate to [www.Starlink.com](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<http:/www.Starlink.com>) and select your option for either Residential (Personal) or Fixed-Site (Business) service plan
  2. Enter your service address
  3. Select "order now"
     * If the rental option is available in your region, you will see the option to either "rent" or "buy" your Starlink. If you do not see the option to "rent" a Starlink, the rental option is not currently available in your select region.


Upon placing the order, you will be charged an immediate one-time activation fee. Once you receive your Starlink kit and activate service; we will automatically charge your payment method on file making this the reoccurring Payment Due Date. 
If you do not activate service within 30 days post-shipment, billing will automatically begin then, making that the Payment Due Date. All future subscription payments will be charged every month on the above Payment Due Date.
If you are a current Starlink customer with the rent Starlink option & would like to purchase your kit to become the owner of it, please create a support ticket.
