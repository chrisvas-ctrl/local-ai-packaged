### How do I cancel my shop order?
You can cancel your shop order (mounts, accessories, etc.) if your order has not been packed for shipment yet. Once your order is placed your 3 hour window to update your order will start. Once this passes your order will be released and may no longer be able to be cancel. In this case, you can attempt to contact the carrier listed in your tracking information after it ships or you may return the item after it has been delivered.
