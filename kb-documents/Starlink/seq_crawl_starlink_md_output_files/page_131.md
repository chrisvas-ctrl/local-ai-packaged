### How do I track my shipment?
You'll receive an email notification once your order is shipped. Please note that it may take up to 3 hours for order statuses to be updated. You can track your shipment anytime from your Starlink account.
Website: 
  * Login to your [account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>)
  * Select the "Home" tab 
  * Under "Your Orders", locate the order you wish to track and select "view"
  * Click on the tracking number to view the shipping status of the order with the carrier


Starlink App: 
  1. Log into the Starlink App
  2. Select the "Person" icon 
  3. Select the "Orders" page
  4. There will be a box per order, showing the order status and tracking information (tracking link if available)


_Note - You can also view this information on the details screen for each order, by clicking into the specific order._
After your order ships, you can manage the delivery of your order by contacting the designated [delivery carrier](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=c954e904-6c7b-0171-e845-567390f8bfb1>). If you’ve received a notice that your billing cycle will begin soon and your Starlink Kit has been in transit for the past 30 days, rest assured that your 30-day trial period will be extended by an additional 30 days, and a one-month service credit will be applied to your account. 
  * **For Brazil deliveries:** When DHL attempts delivery, they may communicate with you through WhatsApp. Please make sure you respond to DHL messages in order to best coordinate delivery.


If you are waiting on your order to ship, you can view the estimated shipping timeline provided on your order details page. We will notify you if the estimated shipping timeline changes.
