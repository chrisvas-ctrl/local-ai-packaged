### Why do I need to align my Starlink?
_The alignment tool is only relevant for users of the: Starlink Standard Kit, Starlink Enterprise Kit, and Starlink Mini Kit._
In order for Starlink to receive the best connection, your Starlink must be able to communicate with as many satellites above as possible. This means that your Starlink must be properly aligned with the satellite network overhead.
If your Starlink is misaligned or laid flat, you may experience service interruptions due to the rainwater accumulating. Please ensure you keep your Starlink in the tilted position with the provided kickstand to prevent service dropouts.
