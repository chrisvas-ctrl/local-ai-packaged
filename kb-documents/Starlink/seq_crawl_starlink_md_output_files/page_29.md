### How do I reactivate service?
To view instructions on how to activate service for a Starlink purchased from an authorized retailer or transferred from a third party, click [here.](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=9c053dcc-c9ba-f64b-c413-af6afc3d6e13>)
  1. Log into your account on starlink.com
  2. Select the "Subscriptions" tab and then select the service line you want to activate
  3. Click "Activate Service"
  4. Select your service plan


To activate your service, you have the option of picking your previous plan or choosing a new one. Please note, some service plans may not be available and service plan prices are subject to change.
**Limitations of reactivation:**
  * **Availability** - The ability to reactivate Standard and Priority service is dependent on capacity in the area. You can view Starlink's service availability map on [starlink.com/map.](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/map>) If there is no capacity in the area, there will be the option to reactivate with a Mobile type service plan.
  * **Unauthorized retailer/reseller** - We are unable to activate service for a Starlink that has been purchased from an unauthorized retailer or reseller. 
  * **Country moves** - We do not support Starlink reactivation in a different country at this time. To use Starlink in a different country, you must create an account in the desired country.
