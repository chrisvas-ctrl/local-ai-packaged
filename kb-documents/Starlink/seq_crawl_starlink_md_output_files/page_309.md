### What is the "Late Adopter" configuration?
Starlink Enterprise and Premium customers can configure terminals to get software updates as part of the "Default" schedule or as a "Late Adopter". Late Adopter hardware will get the software update after it has been rolled out to the majority of terminals without issue. All software updates are vetted and tested before release, but being a Late Adopter can give additional assurance if you have a terminal that is especially critical for connectivity. If you have multiple terminals, it could be helpful to configure a percentage of your fleet on the Default schedule to enable internal testing and validation for your specific use case before it is released to the broader fleet.
This "Late Adopter" configuration is set by terminal. To configure this setting, follow these steps:
  1. Go to the dashboard on Starlink.com.
  2. Open a service line that you would like to change.
  3. In the devices section at the bottom of the screen, click "Configure".
  4. In "Software Group" in the bottom right, choose between Default and Late Adopter.
     * Equipment will be set to the Default software group unless manually updated.
