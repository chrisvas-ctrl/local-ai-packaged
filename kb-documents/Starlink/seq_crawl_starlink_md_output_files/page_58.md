### How does the Installment Payment Plan work?
_Currently only available in Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Peru._
When ordering through Starlink.com, if you use a local (non-international) credit card, you’ll have the option to pay in installments after entering your payment details. The number of installments and any interest charges are determined by your credit card provider—please check with them for details. Note: interest charges do not apply in Argentina, Mexico and Panama.
