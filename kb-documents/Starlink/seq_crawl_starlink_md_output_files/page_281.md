The differences are outlined below.
**First Time Setup Process:** Both Starlinks are electronic phased array antennas, meaning they can track the signal from satellites overhead without the need to physically move. Once Starlink is properly set up with no obstructions and proper alignment, you will not be required to adjust it again in the future. Both hardware's are set up by the user manually adjusting the Starlink with guidance from the alignment tool in the Starlink App. 
**Included Equipment:**
**Starlink** - Starlink Standard has a slightly larger surface area than the Starlink Mini.
**Router** - The Starlink Standard comes with a Gen 3 WiFi Router, whereas Starlink Mini comes with integrated WiFi.
**Mount** - Both Starlink Mini and Starlink Standard come with a built-in kickstand that can flip out for quick deployment or fold away for storage, making them suitable for quick setup or portable use. They can also be drilled into a flat surface for permanent installation. Additionally, the Starlink Mini Kit includes a Mini Pipe Adapter and Flat Mount, designed to attach to any existing pole with a diameter between 31 mm (1.25 in) and 50 mm (2 in).
**Cables** - Both include a Starlink cable length of 50 ft (15.2m) with longer cable options on the shop, specific to each kit.
**Power Supply** - Both Starlink Standard and Starlink Mini power supply stand alone as a separate item.
