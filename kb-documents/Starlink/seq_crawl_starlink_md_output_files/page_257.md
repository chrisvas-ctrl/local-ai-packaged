​
The Gen 3 router is compatible with the Starlink Standard Actuated, Starlink Standard, Starlink Mini, Starlink High Performance, and the Starlink Standard Circular.
​

​
**Getting Connected: If you're using the Gen 3 router with the Starlink Standard Kit, follow the steps below:**
  1. Connect to the STARLINK network from your device WiFi settings.
     * 'STARLINK' is the router's default WiFi network name (SSID).
  2. To secure your Starlink WiFi network, use the Starlink App to rename your Starlink WiFi network and create a WiFi password. Open the Starlink App > Settings > Router > enter desired WiFi network name and password > Save.
     * This step is optional, however we recommend securing your WiFi network. Your Starlink WiFi network is not password protected until you set the password.


![setup_guide_standard_connect_to_wifi](https://www.starlink.com/public-files/setup_guide_standard_connect_to_wifi.png)
  1. You are now connected! To customize additional settings, check your connection, and more, visit the Starlink App.


​
**Below are steps listed to connect a Gen 3 router in combination with a Gen 2 Router in use:**
  1. Ensure your Starlink is set up and connected to the internet prior to setting up the Gen 3 router by connecting to your existing Starlink WiFi network from your device. 
  2. We recommended placing both routers in the same room for the best performance, or to choose a location for your Gen 3 router that is in line of sight of your Gen 2 Router. 
  3. After unboxing your Gen 3 router, plug the router into a power outlet with the power cable and power supply. 
  4. Open the Starlink App and wait 1-2 minutes for the notification: "PAIR NEW MESH NODE", then click "PAIR". The Gen 3 router will begin connecting on the NETWORK screen for about 1-2 minutes. 
  5. Once connected, the Gen 3 Router will appear on the NETWORK screen in the app. The light should be solid white.


​
**Using the Extra RJ45 Ports (Gen 3 Router):**
  1. Remove the RJ45 cover on the back of the router. 
  2. Plug in your own ethernet cable to port 1 or 2. Then connect the other end of your cable into your third-party hardware.


​
**Additional Notes:**
  * A standard RJ45 cable can be used in lieu of the Starlink RJ45 cable; however, it is recommended that the provided Starlink RJ45 cable is used to ensure proper sealing.
  * The latching mechanism inside the Starlink RJ45 port is completely passive and only requires a firm tug to remove the cable. It should be possible to remove both the Starlink RJ45 cable or a standard RJ45 cable just by pulling it.
  * If you install a standard RJ45 cable in the Starlink RJ45 port and cannot pull it out, you can use a small screwdriver or similar tool to depress the tab which should release the cable.
  * Available mounting option in the Starlink Shop: [Gen 3 Router Mount](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/public-files/installation_guide_standard_router_mount%203.pdf>)
