### Does Starlink work with VPNs?
Yes. Starlink supports VPNs that use TCP or UDP. SSL based VPNs typically work best to traverse CGNAT. NAT traversal support is required by the VPN.
Using a VPN can sometimes affect your internet performance. When you use a VPN, your data is often encrypted and then sent through different servers before reaching the internet. These extra steps can increase the time it takes for your data to travel back and forth, which might affect your internet performance.
We can help ensure your Starlink connection is working as expected, but please note that we cannot troubleshoot VPN connection issues, as they fall outside the scope of our network support. Additionally, the Starlink App might not function properly when a VPN is in use.
If you're experiencing issues with a VPN while using Starlink, please contact your VPN provider for assistance.
