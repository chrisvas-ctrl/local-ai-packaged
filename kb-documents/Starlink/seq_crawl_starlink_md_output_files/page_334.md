### I fell offline, but was online before.
If you are back online, you may be experiencing intermittent connection (frequent drops in service). Click [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=6723aa37-4414-3bd9-31e8-d2e8334b8ebc>) for additional guidance.
If you are setting up for the first time, please see [How do I set up Starlink?](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=cd99e833-2adc-1cb2-01c3-7f1fbefa3784>).
If you're currently offline, it could be caused by your Starlink account status, and/or by damage to your Starlink Kit. Please confirm the following:
  * Verify that the Starlink subscription for the kit that is offline is active.
  * Check that all payments are up-to-date, and there are no pending payments. Click [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=aa5697e2-6851-8482-c88f-6123e58f8827>) for more guidance.
  * If you do not have a Mobile service plan, verify you are located at the service address registered to your Starlink Kit on your account.
  * Check the length of the cable for any damage.
  * Carefully inspect the cable connectors on both ends for any debris, signs of water ingression possibly resulting in short circuits, or visible physical damage.
  * Unplug and reseat all cables. Ensure they are fully seated.


After confirming the above checks are not a factor and you are still offline, check the Starlink app for any alerts. If there are no alerts, please navigate to the topic to troubleshoot based on what the app screen says:
