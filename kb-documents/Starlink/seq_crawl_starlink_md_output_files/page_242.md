### How do I opt in for additional data?
You can opt in for additional data from your Starlink account page.
  * Local Priority and Global Priority users can purchase additional blocks of priority data, charged per block.
  * Roam 50GB plan users can purchase additional Roam data, charged per GB.


​
**How to Opt In:**
  * Starlink.com: Go to “Subscriptions”, select the service line you want to modify, then under “Data,” enable Automatic Top-Up or add a One-Time Top-Up (not available for Roam 50GB).
  * Starlink app: Tap the Person icon, then “Data Usage,” and enable Automatic Top-Up or add a One-Time Top-Up (not available for Roam 50GB).


​
**How to Opt Out:**
  * Starlink.com: Go to “Subscriptions”, select the service line you want to modify, then under “Data,” disable Automatic Top-Up.
  * Starlink app: Tap the Person icon, then “Data Usage,” and disable Automatic Top-Up.


Note: You can only opt out if you are currently opted in to Automatic Top-Ups.
​
**How it works:**
You can opt in to ensure you automatically receive additional Global or Local Priority data upon exhausting your data limit in a given month. Once you opt-in, you will be automatically billed for data used above your plan's allotment until you opt-out, including in following billing cycles. Additional data is charged per 50 GB used. You can track your monthly data usage in your account. Your additional purchased data will be displayed and charged on your next monthly invoice. Your bill may show less data than reflected in your Data Tracker, as we subtract data used by backend Starlink operations (i.e. software updates). If your service is currently paused, you must activate service to see the toggle.
​
**Important note on ocean use:**
If you are on a Roam service plan, you will need to opt-in to Mobile Priority data in order to use Starlink on international waters.
Ocean use in territorial waters and in-motion use on land is dependent on country authorizations. View where you can order maritime or land in-motion service [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/sg/support/article/4497c64e-d214-803a-bd8d-1f0c957b894d>). Review the [specifications](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/specifications?spec=3\(>) to see approved hardware for in-motion use.
​
**Important note for opting in after an ocean, continent, or location restriction has been enforced:**
If you have a custom network setup or configuration (VPN, content filtering, third-party routers, etc), this may block access to your Starlink account to Opt-in or upgrade for additional Priority data while connected to the Starlink network. You will need to remove your customizations or connect to a different network to access your Starlink account. Additional details can be found in the [Starlink Fair Use Policy](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal>).
