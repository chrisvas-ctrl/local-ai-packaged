### How do I return my Starlink?
**To return your Starlink (unopened or used kit):**
  1. Log in to your Starlink Account
  2. Select the "Subscriptions" tab and then select the service line you want to return
  3. Click "Manage" in the Service Plan box
  4. Check the box labeled "I would like to return my hardware" to return your Starlink (if you do not see this option, your Starlink is not eligible for a return)
  5. Confirm your selection
  6. You will receive a pre-paid return label via email, please check if your spam folder and search the email subject "Your Starlink Return". You can also re-download your return label via desktop (not available on app) on your Order Summary page by clicking the three dots on the right side next to "Return Initiated". If you have any issues finding your return label please reach out to support.


**Return Policy:** If you cancelled within the 30-day return period, you will be eligible for a full refund. If you decide to return your hardware outside the 30-day window, you may still qualify for a partial refund (subject to eligibility). For more details on Starlinks return policy, see our [Terms of Service](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal>).
  * If you purchased your Starlink from an authorized retailer or reseller, contact them directly to return your Starlink.
  * If you have rented a Starlink Kit, you must return your equipment in good condition within 30 days of service cancellation. If you do not return the kit in good condition you will be charged the full price of the kit, as described on the online order page.
    * Starlink will issue you a return shipping label at the time of cancellation to use to return the kit (follow instructions in the Starlinks Return Policy for returning rented Kits in the Starlink Customer Portal).


Notes: 
  * This process does not apply to the Standard (Circular) hardware.
  * (Brazil Customers) If you are a customer in Brazil, please contact Customer Support by creating a support ticket in order to return your Starlink. Returns in Brazil require contacting Customer Support, as the return labels will not be immediately sent to your email.


**Preparing your return:**
  1. [Stow your Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=76c3666b-97ae-6ae3-e629-143910488d90>)
  2. Re-box the hardware
     * If you are returning a kit as a part of a replacement, but no longer have your original box, you can wait for your replacement kit to arrive in order to use the new box for return. (If you decide to use the new box for returning your replaced Starlink hardware, please ensure to remove or cover the serial number. Failure to do this could result in issues with your return.) For more information about Starlink replacement returns, [click here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=5cdc5c31-3af4-d9eb-d0c3-7fc8e85389f5>).
     * If your Starlink will not stow, or will not fit in the original box, you can use a bigger box to return your Starlink.
     * **Important:** Please only return your Starlink equipment. Do not include any other items.
  3. Print and attach the return labels to the outside of the box
  4. Drop it off at the carrier listed on your return label
  5. You will receive a refund for your hardware and first month subscription cost (shipping not included) within 10-15 business days
