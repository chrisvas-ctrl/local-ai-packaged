### How do I return my mount or accessory?

  1. Navigate to the "[Your Orders](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>)" tab, then select the affected order.
  2. Click "Return" under the Order Details section and follow the steps to initiate your return. 
  3. If the "Return" button is not shown click "Contact Support" at the bottom of this topic within 30 days of receiving your order.
  4. Select the the order number and include the item name in your message to reach Support for further assistance.
