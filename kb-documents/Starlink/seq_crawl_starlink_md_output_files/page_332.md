### I cannot get online during initial setup.
Ensure you have followed all of the setup steps in the Starlink App:
  1. **Find a clear view of the sky.** Use your mobile device and find "Check for Obstructions" tool on the Starlink app ([iOS](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/apps.apple.com/us/app/starlink/id1537177988>), [Android](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starlink.mobile>)) to identify the most optimal install location that will deliver the best service.
