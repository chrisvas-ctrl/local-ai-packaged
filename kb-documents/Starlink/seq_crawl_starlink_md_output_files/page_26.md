**Change to higher cost plan:** The change will be effective immediately. You will be charged a pro-rated cost dependent on the plan monthly cost difference and time remaining on your current billing cycle.
**Change to a lower cost plan:** Your current service plan will remain the same, and your new service plan will take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. You will be charged the new monthly service cost at the start of your next billing cycle.
**Change to a same cost plan:** The change will be effective immediately. As there is no cost difference, the change will be at no cost to you.
**Limitations:**
