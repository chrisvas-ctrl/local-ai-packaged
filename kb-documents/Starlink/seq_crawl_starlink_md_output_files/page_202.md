### How do I deactivate/cancel a service line using the dashboard?
To deactivate/cancel a service line in the [dashboard](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/dashboard>), follow the steps below:
  1. Open your Starlink [dashboard](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/dashboard>)
  2. Locate the Starlink you wish to deactivate/cancel and select the "Manage" button
  3. From the drop down options for the indicated service line select "Cancel Service Line"
  4. Select "Yes" to complete the cancellation. Once complete, billing for the indicated service line will end. Service will continue until the end of the current billing cycle


**Note:** When deactivating/cancelling a service line, you will not be billed for that service line on your next billing day of the month. All Starlinks on that service line will get service until the day before the next billing day of the month. 
Never remove all Starlinks from your service line before you have deactivated/canceled the service line. If you do not cancel your service line, but remove your Starlinks, you will continue to be billed for service.
