#### How does the 30 day trial work?
The 30-day trial mentioned on the Starlink website does not indicate that the first month of service is free, as it is not a 30-day free trial but rather a trial of the Starlink hardware. Instead, it refers to how, if you are unhappy with the service or product within the first 30 days of using the service after billing has begun, you can return the hardware for a full refund. 
Please note, your first month's bill is not included in your initial hardware purchase. Instead, it is billed upon activation (or 30 days after your Starlink ships).
#### What does Reservation or Deposit Mean?
If you attempt to place your order at a location that no longer has capacity, the system will redirect you to place a deposit. Once you complete your order, you will be charged a one-time fee for this deposit. This amount will then be subtracted from the total due for Starlink equipment when availability becomes available. 
When a kit is purchased from an authorized dealer, it is important to confirm in advance whether there is service availability in the given area. You can do this by entering your service address in our availability map: <https://starlink.com/map> Light blue means available, blue means wait list, and navy blue indicates that we will soon have service at that location.
#### How do I activate a 2nd hand Starlink?
Provided that the kit has been successfully transferred by the previous owner, you can follow the normal activation steps here: <https://www.starlink.com/support/article/9c053dcc-c9ba-f64b-c413-af6afc3d6e13>
#### How do I update the email address on my account for a new owner?
If you intend to transfer ownership of your Starlink, please follow the transer steps detailed [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/f3cad923-ed28-f957-365c-787f8fe2e4a2>). 
#### I am trying to reactivate service. Why does the reactivate button not show up?
It is possible that this is because services are unavailable due to capacity issues in your area. You can check the Starlink service availability map at <https://starlink.com/map> to confirm if your area is at full capacity. 
If an area is at capacity, you may still be able to reactivate on a Roam service plan (depending on your location). Please note, you will be unable to switch from a Roam service plan to a Standard or Priority service plan until your area has available capacity.
#### I accidentally checked "return equipment" when canceling service, but I don't want to return the equipment.
Since you do not want to return the equipment, you can simply disregard the email containing your return shipping label.
#### How long does it take to receive service after paying past due balance?
If you just paid off your past due balance but your account is still restricted, please allow up to 1 hour for your payment to process. Service should automatically reactivate immediately after the payment for an outstanding balance is processed, but sometimes it may take up to 1 hour. We appreicate your patience. 
#### How do I activate a Starlink without the QR Code?
You can use either the KIT number that comes in the box where the equipment arrived or the serial number located on the bottom of the antenna. 
In either case you can use: <https://starlink.com/activate>.
#### How do I activate outside my current country?
Changing your service address to a location outside the country your account is registered is not supported, though you may still be able to activate on Roam. If you do so, service will continue for up to 60 days outside your registered country. After that time, your service may be suspended. 
If you plan on staying in the new country for longer than 60 days, we would suggest transferring the Starlink to a new account registered to the new country.
#### I already activated. Why does my app still says activate Starlink now?
The notification should go away within 30 minutes of activation.
#### How do I activate Starlink if I don't have an existing internet connection?
You are still able to connect to your Starlink even if you are inactive or if you haven't activated yet. From there you will be able to activate/reactivate as needed.
#### How do I change my account name / the name on my account?
You are currently unable to change the name on your Starlink account, though you are able to add additional users. If you need the account to be under a different name, we recommend that you transfer the device to a new account. See <https://www.starlink.com/support/article/b33da5ba-46f4-c93a-5cbb-700edae91188>
#### Why did an error occur when trying to reactivate service?
You may have received an error if your service was suspended for a past due balance, or if you paused/cancelled your service with an outstanding balance. In order to reactivate, you must pay off the balance. You can view your balance in the billing tab of your account, and you can make a payment by selecting 'Make a Payment'.
#### Why am I being billed when I am setting up my Starlink?
When you buy Starlink from starlink.com, you are charged for the Starlink kit, but not your first month's service. 
Your first bill will occur either on activation or 30 days after your Starlink ships, whichever comes first. 
The 30-day trial mentioned on the Starlink website does not indicate the first month of service being free, as it is not a 30-day free trial but just a trial of the Starlink hardware. 
Instead, it refers to how, if you are unhappy with the service or product within the first 30 days of using the service after billing has begun, you can return the hardware for a full refund. 
#### How do I update my mailing address?
You can update your default shipping address directly from your Starlink account home page: <https://www.starlink.com/account/home>
#### How do I update my phone number for Two Step Verification?
Please follow the steps [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/211c35fe-7841-da58-1d38-4e314cc43868>) to update your phone number. 
#### How do I view current or past Support Tickets?

You can also view your Support tickets directly by clicking [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/tickets>).
#### How do I cancel my deposit / pre-order and get a refund?
You can cancel your deposit by follow these steps:
  1. Visit account home page
  2. Click subscriptions
  3. Click manage next to the one that says "Deposit"
  4. Click "Cancel Deposit"


#### The white film/sticker on my Starlink dish has minor scuffs, scratches, or pits. Does this impact my service?
No, cosmetic damage to the white cover on your Starlink dish (such as scuffs, scratches, or small pits) will not affect your service performance. The Starlink is designed to maintain optimal performance even with slight imperfections on its surface.
#### How do I change from a Priority Plan / Business account to a Residential account?
The Starlink Terms of Service prohibit business or enterprise use of the Residential and Roam service plans. If you are currently an individual using a priority plan / Business account you will need to transfer your device and create a new residential account. Here's how you can do it: 
  1. Transfer Your Device: Start by transferring your current device to a new account. For detailed instructions, please follow [this link](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/f3cad923-ed28-f957-365c-787f8fe2e4a2>).
  2. Create a New Residential Account: Once your device is transferred, you can activate it under a new Residential account by visiting [Starlink Activation](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/activate>)


Please make sure that your service address has enough capacity before you initate the transfer. You can do so by entering your address into the [availability map](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/map>)
