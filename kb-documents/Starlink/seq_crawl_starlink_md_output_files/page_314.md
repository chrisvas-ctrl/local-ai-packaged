### Does Starlink provide time synchronization or NTP servers?
Yes, each Starlink runs an NTP server based on GPS time, which can be accessed by configuring your NTP client to use 192.168.100.1. The time is based on GPS; however, we cannot guarantee accuracy as the service is provided on a best-effort basis.
