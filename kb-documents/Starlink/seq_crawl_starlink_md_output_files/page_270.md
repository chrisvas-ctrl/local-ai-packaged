### Starlink Mini - USB-C Cable
![Starlink_mini_usb_c_cable](https://www.starlink.com/public-files/starlink_mini_usb_c_cable.png)
The 5m (16.4 ft) Mini USB-C cable is designed to power your Starlink Mini on-the-go via USB-C, replacing the Mini 15m Power Cable from the Starlink Mini Kit. Requires a 100W (20V/5A) power source.
**Compatibility:**
  * The Starlink USB-C cable should only be used with your Starlink Mini. This USB-C cable is specifically designed for powering your Starlink Mini and is not suitable for powering or charging USB-C devices like cellphones. It is also not compatible with a Starlink Gen3 Router.


**Water Resistance:**
  * The barrel jack end of the cable forms a IP67 rated connection with the Starlink Mini kit, providing protection against water ingress. The USB-C end of the cable should not be exposed to outdoor environments.


**Power Requirements:**
  * The Starlink Mini USB-C cable requires a 100W 20V, 5A source.


**LED Status Light:**
  * **No Light** No power to USB-C Cable. If the LED is off and you are unable to connect to Starlink please check the LED on the back of the Starlink Mini. If the LED on Starlink Mini is off, your power supply may not be turned on.
  * **Red Light Solid** A red light on the USB-C cable indicates that the power source being used is not compatible and does not have the correct output rating of 20V/5A. Please check the specifications of the specific USB-C port you are connecting to.
  * **Red Light Flashing** Incorrect usage. Starlink USB-C cable is not intended to charge USB-C devices using the Starlink Mini power supply.
