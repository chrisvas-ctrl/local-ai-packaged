#### (Consistent - Outside of Peak Hours)
If you are experiencing speed issues consistently throughout the day, it may be a Router/WiFi issue or your local setup.
  1. Check the Starlink app home screen for any alerts indicating network outages, obstructions, or hardware issues.
  2. Ensure your Starlink is being used in the correct service location listed on your account. If you have Starlink Mobile service, you may experience slower speeds. 
  3. Check that nothing is blocking Starlink’s view that may be affecting the signal, including heavy dirt or debris or any covering on the face of the Starlink. See [How do I clean my Starlink? ](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=587a41e0-9ab4-85ae-0aec-c3f163863436>)for additional tips.
  4. Power cycle your Starlink and router by unplugging and re-plugging the AC cable from your wall outlet.
  5. Remove all third-party hardware and conduct a speed test during off-peak hours using the Starlink app and router. The Starlink app provides two advanced speed test options:
     * Device to Internet - Measures end-to-end speeds from your device running the Starlink app and the internet. This test uses a similar methodology to other speed test providers, and factors in your device's WiFi connection.
     * Device to Router - Measures the connection quality between your device and your Starlink router. If this number is lower than your router speed test, you may be bottlenecked by your WiFi connection.


Confirm your device has good signal strength and is using the 5Ghz band. See the 'Network' screen in the app for more client information. You can visit the Starlink shop to purchase a mesh node to extend the connection throughout your home. See [How can I improve my WiFi connectivity?](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=f28de520-ef3f-138d-9f69-7f1b37433f1e>) for more detailed tips on optimizing your environment.
​ 
#### (Variable - During Peak Hours)
Peak hours are the times during the day when many Starlink users are trying to use their service at the same time (typically between 6pm and 11pm local time). While we do our best to optimize performance for all users, you may experience varying or slower speeds during these times of peak usage. If you have Starlink Mobile service, you may experience slower speeds.
We are constantly trying to improve your Starlink service by expanding the Starlink satellite constellation through additional launches to connect more of the world to high speed internet.
