### I moved to a new country. Can I change my address?
Changing your account service and shipping address to a different country than the country used upon sign up is not supported.
You can permanently transfer your Starlink onto a new account to any country Starlink is actively serving ([starlink.com/map](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/map>)). Transferring your Starlink will cancel your current service and remove the corresponding Starlink hardware from your account. See transfer requirements [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=f3cad923-ed28-f957-365c-787f8fe2e4a2>).
After you have completed the Starlink transfer process, you can create your new account with the new country's service and shipping address. Creating a new account requires the use of a new email address. Visit [starlink.com/activate](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/activate>) to activate your Starlink.
