### How do I stow my Starlink?
To stow Starlink Standard (Circular), Starlink Standard Actuated or Starlink High Performance for return or storage, open the Starlink app and navigate to Settings > Starlink, then drag the slider to "Stow Starlink".
If your Starlink is not connected to the App, you can manually stow your Starlink:
  1. Make sure Starlink is plugged in.
  2. Take Starlink out of the base.
  3. Place Starlink face down on a flat surface like a table. After about a minute, the Starlink mast will automatically tilt into the stow position.
  4. Once the Starlink stows, unplug the device so that it remains in stow position.


**Note:**
  * To store your Starlink Standard or Starlink Mini, fold the kickstand under Starlink. 
  * Flat High Performance Starlink does not require stowing.
  * If you are stowing your Starlink to return and it will not stow, you can use a bigger box to return your Starlink.
