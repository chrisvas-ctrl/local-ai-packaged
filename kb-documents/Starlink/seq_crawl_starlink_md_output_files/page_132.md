### Why did my expected ship date change?
Adjustments to the shipping timeline may occur due to factors such as inventory shortages or order backlogs, which can impede our ability to meet your original delivery expectations. It's not uncommon to see the timeline extended 1-2 times, and we want you to rest assured that our top priority is getting your order to you as quickly as possible.
