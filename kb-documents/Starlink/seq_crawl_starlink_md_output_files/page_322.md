### Speed Issues - Third-Party Router
  1. Please remove all third-party hardware (if possible) and conduct a speed test during off-peak hours using the Starlink app and router.
  2. Compare the speed test results with the [Expected Speeds Per Service Plan](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal/documents/DOC-1400-28829-70?regionCode=US>) chart.
  3. Click "Contact Support" to submit a support ticket should the speed test results appear to not be within the expected speed range. Please include screenshots of your speed test results and details of the date and time the tests were ran to further help our investigation.


**Usage During Peak Hours** : Peak hours are the times during the day when many Starlink users are trying to use their service at the same time (typically between 6pm and 11pm local time). While we do our best to optimize performance for all users, you may experience varying or slower speeds during these times of peak usage. If you have Starlink Mobile service, you may experience slower speeds. We are constantly trying to improve your Starlink service by expanding the Starlink satellite constellation through additional launches to connect more of the world to high speed internet.
Note: You are welcome to connect your own equipment to Starlink, however we cannot guarantee Starlink performance or compatibility with third-party networking devices.
