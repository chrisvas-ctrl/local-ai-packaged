Additional Notes:
  * Service activation and billing start date for your Starlink **is not dependent** on installation appointment date. We recommend scheduling your appointment for the earliest availability.
    * Service activation is when you power on and connect your Starlink for the first time, Or 30 days post-Starlink Kit shipment, whichever happens first.
  * Once the installation service is completed, the installation cost is not refundable. Starlink is not responsible for downtime experienced during installation.
  * You are responsible for reaching out and contracting with the third-party installer directly. Starlink shall not be responsible, nor does Starlink assume any liability for the pricing, contract terms, quality of work, errors, omissions, or misrepresentations made by the installers, any alterations made to or damage that may occur to your property, as a result of the installation. See Starlink's [Terms of Service](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal/documents/DOC-1020-91087-64?regionCode=US>) for more details.
  * If you are not located close to a recommended third-party installer, we have had customers find success working with contractors in their local area that have experience with roof and external wall installations. Everything else for getting online, the Starlink will do automatically (boot up, connect, find satellites).
