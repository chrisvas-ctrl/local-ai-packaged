### What is bypass mode?
Bypass mode allows you turn off the Starlink router and connect a third-party router directly to Starlink. When bypass mode is activated, the Starlink router’s WiFi features are completely disabled. You can enable bypass mode in the Starlink app under “Settings.” To disable bypass mode, you can perform a [factory reset](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=d68ed178-4d54-b486-b7d8-2a6273917632>). 
​
**Standard Actuated Starlink with Gen 2 Router:**
  * You will need an ethernet adapter to connect a third-party router.


​
**Standard Starlink with Gen 3 Router:**
  * Enable bypass mode using the Starlink app.
  * Once bypass mode is enabled, you can plug your third-party router directly into one of the ethernet ports on the back of the router.
  * A violet light will appear, indicating that the router is in bypass mode. The light will turn off after one hour. To exit bypass mode, you will need to perform a factory reset.


​
**Starlink Mini:**
  * We recommend using the official Starlink Mini ethernet cable to maintain the Mini’s weatherproofing.


​
**Starlink Enterprise:**
  * Instead of bypassing, simply plug in the third-party router to the power supply.
  * Prior to setting up your third-party router, ensure you have an active Starlink account. You can activate your account at Starlink.com/activate before proceeding with your third-party setup to establish an online connection.


​
**High Performance and Flat High Performance Starlink with Gen 2 Router:**
  * Instead of bypassing, simply plug in the third-party router to the power supply.


​
**Standard Circular Starlink with Gen 1 Router:**
  * Instead of bypassing, directly replace the Gen1 router with your third-party router.
