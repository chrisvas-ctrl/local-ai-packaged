### Two Step Verification
**What is this?** Two step verification is an additional security measure Starlink is using to help protect your account. In addition to your password, you will need to verify your identify with a passcode sent to your email or phone number. Starlink will never call or text you for this passcode. Do not share it with anyone.
**Why are we doing this?** To help keep your account more secure and only have you accessing your account! 
**When does this happen?** When signing in, changing your account information, or adding a user to your account you will be prompted to enter your verification passcode.
_**My passcode expired:**_
  * If your passcodes expired, request a new one. 
  * If you have too many outstanding passcodes, wait 15 minutes and then request a new one.


_**I am signed into my account and unable to successfully verify:**_
  * If you typed the passcode incorrectly, retry. Request a new code if still unsuccessful. 
  * If you have access to your original email, click "resend passcode" and check spam folder in email. 
  * If you do not have access to your original email, please resend passcode via SMS.
    * if you do not receive SMS, make sure your phone does not have cookies blocked.
  * If you are still having issues, submit [support ticket](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/>) for help.


_**I am not signed into my account and unable to successfully verify:**_
  * If you typed the passcode incorrectly, retry. Request a new code if still unsuccessful. 
  * If you do not have access to your email or phone number, attempt [password recovery](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/auth/forgot-password>).
  * If you do not receive SMS, make sure your phone does not have cookies blocked.
  * If exhausted the above for both email and SMS, contact support another way [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/guest-contact?source=two_step_verification_faq>).


_I am on the app and unable to successfully verify:_
  * Update your app to the latest version then retry.
