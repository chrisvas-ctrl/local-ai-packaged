### Can I delay the shipment of my order?
We are unable to delay shipping timelines. After your order ships, you can manage the delivery of your order by contacting the designated [delivery carrier](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=c954e904-6c7b-0171-e845-567390f8bfb1>).
For Starlink Kit deposits: We are unable to extend your order confirmation window. If the Starlink purchase is not completed within the 7 day allotted timeframe, your deposit will be cancelled and refunded to the original form of payment.
