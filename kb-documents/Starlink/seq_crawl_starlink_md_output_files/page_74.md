### Can I manually transfer funds to Starlink?
Payment via wire or electronic transfer is not supported, unless you have an existing agreement with Starlink to manually transfer funds. If you pay for service directly from your bank account (such as ACH in the United States or SEPA in Europe), please be sure to make all payments through your Starlink account portal.
