### Where is Starlink Enterprise Kit available?
The Starlink Enterprise Kit is now available in the United States and select international markets to Business and Enterprise customers. You can purchase the kit through Starlink.com/business and Starlink.com/shop.
The kit includes a Starlink Standard terminal, a high-performance power supply, a 50m Enterprise cable, a 1.8m AC power cable, a 5m Ethernet cable, and a choice of mount (e.g., Pipe Adapter, Wall Mount, or Pivot Mount). A WiFi router can be purchased separately at Starlink.com/shop.
The Starlink Enterprise Kit will expand to other markets over time. However, we do not have estimated dates to provide at this time.
