### Aviation Troubleshooting
For assistance with troubleshooting connectivity or service issues on a Starlink aviation antenna, please always submit a support ticket from your account. Make sure to include the details of the problems you’re experiencing along with the date, time, duration of the issue, and a specific list of affected devices and applications that are not working. Please note, in order to troubleshoot the issue, the aircraft must be on the ground and the Starlink terminal must be powered on. For this reason, we may reach out to schedule a time that works best for you, so please be sure to monitor ticket responses.
