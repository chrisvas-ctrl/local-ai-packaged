### I have received the email to confirm my order, but my information is incorrect or has changed. What do I do?
When you click Confirm My Order in the email, it will redirect you to an order confirmation screen on your account page. From there, you can review the following details:
  * **Service address:** Changing your service address is subject to availability. If the new service address does not have availability at that time, your order will not be processed and you will see a new expected service date on your account page. You will still hold your place in the queue at the new location.
  * **Shipping address:** Changing the shipping address registered to your account or any pending order is not supported. If you need any item shipped to a different address than the address listed on your existing order [click here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=c6bc0fec-cec0-f2a7-ee35-ec5207be4a2a>)
  * **Payment Method:** Please be sure your card is not expired. If your bank requires a 3D verification, you will be redirected to verify your payment by receiving a PIN code via text.
