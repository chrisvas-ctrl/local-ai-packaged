### Where is Starlink "Roam" available? 
**Currently the Roam 50GB service plan option is only available for Starlink Mini at the time of placing an order. Customers purchasing Starlink Standard may move to the Roam 50GB service plan after their first month. This will not affect any existing Roam 50GB users using Starlink Standard.**
There are 3 Roam (Mobile) plans available - Roam 50GB, Roam Unlimited, & (Mobile) Global.
  * See continent map [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/public-files/Global_Arbitrage_Policy_Enforcement.png>). This map is for the regional grouping only and does not indicate service availability.


To check if Starlink Roam is available in your area:
  1. Go to Starlink.com/roam.
  2. Click “Order Now.”
  3. In the dropdown menu, select your country.
     * If your country is not listed, Starlink Roam is not currently available.
  4. If available, the “Service” section will display the Starlink Roam service plan options for your selected country.


**Included with the Starlink "Roam" Service Plan:**
  * Unlimited or 50GB of data 
  * Countrywide coverage (including inland waterways and marinas) within country of account address
  * In-motion use up to 100 Mph / 160 Kph
  * Ability to pause and un-pause service at any time (billing is in one-month increments)
  * International travel in [available markets](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/map>) for up to 2 months per trip
  * Coastal ocean coverage (up to 12 nautical miles off the coast) where Starlink provides [active coverage](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/map>) around the world for up to 5 consecutive days at a time and a total of 60 days over the course of a one year period
  * For Roam 50GB, ability to opt into purchasing additional data by the GB is supported


​ 
**Important notes:**
  * You can only upgrade your service plan after activating your service.
  * Starlink Roam service plans are intended strictly for low demand, portable, non commercial-use such as camping or nomadic living.
  * Ocean and aviation use is not supported with Roam. 
  * If you currently have the Roam 50GB (Bundle) and upgrade to the higher-priced Roam 50GB plan, you will not be able to go back to the lower-priced plan.
  * The pause feature is available for orders purchased under "Roam" on [Starlink.com](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<http:/starlink.com/>) with Roam 50GB or Roam Unlimited service plans. The pause feature is not available with the Roam 50GB (Bundle) plan. To enable the pause feature, you can upgrade your service to Roam 50GB, Roam Unlimited, or Mobile Priority.
  * For 50GB/mo plans, keep in mind that 50GB is approximately equivalent to 20+ hours of high-definition video streaming.
  * If you exceed the allotted data on the 50GB plan and have not opted in to additional data, you will be unable to use the internet except to access your Starlink account.
  * If you use Starlink Roam in a country different from your shipping address for over two months, Starlink may require you to update your registered address to your new location. If your new location is not in an authorized territory (marked "Available" or "Waitlist" on the Starlink map), your service may be immediately suspended. See [Terms of Service](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal>) for more information.


**Hardware and Warranty:** Flat High Performance, Standard, and Mini are the approved Starlinks for in-motion use. Customers using an actuated Starlink that contains motors (ex. Standard Actuated Starlink, High Performance Starlink) while in motion do so at their own risk as they are not designed for in-motion use; equipment falling onto the road or off a vessel due to poor installation practices can cause serious accidents resulting in bodily injury or damage to property. Damage to the Starlink while in motion may result in a void of your Starlink warranty. **For customers in Japan, the only hardware certified for maritime use is the Flat High Performance, Standard, and Mini.**
