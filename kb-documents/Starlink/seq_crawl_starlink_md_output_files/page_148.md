### How many terminals can I link to a subscription? 
In most cases, one service line accommodates one subscription, one service address, and one Starlink terminal. 
Only Enterprise accounts (managed accounts) with a Mobile Priority service plan, except Mobile Priority Unlimited, can have up to two Starlink terminals per service line. Mobile Priority Unlimited service plan can only have one Starlink terminal assignment per service line.
Note: If two Starlink terminals share one service line, both of those Starlink terminals must be on the same vessel, vehicle, or building.
**Enterprise (managed account) instructions:**
  1. Log in to your Starlink account
  2. Select "Manage" next to the desired Mobile Priority service line
  3. Select "Add Starlink" and enter the terminal's credentials
