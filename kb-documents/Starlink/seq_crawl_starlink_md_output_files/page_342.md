### Does weather impact my service quality?
Significant weather can cause service degradation due to attenuation of the radio signals. Moderate to heavy rain, snow, and hail can cause momentary service dropouts. 
Storm systems near our local ground stations can also impact service. However, our extensive network connected to laser-augmented satellites allows us to route traffic around storm systems to reduce impact on service. 
During typical storms or weather events, you may notice short drops or interruptions in service which should return to normal as soon as the weather passes. There are a few steps you can take ahead of time to minimize disruptions to your service:
  * Make sure all of your cables are fully plugged in.
  * Ensure your Starlink is securely mounted.
  * (Optional) Set up a surge protector to safeguard against any unexpected power surges.


If you are in the path of hurricane-force winds, we recommend the following to minimize potential hardware issues and disruptions to your service:
  * If it is safe to do so, we recommend to bring your Starlink and cables indoors.
  * If you cannot bring your cable inside, protect the exposed ends from water. If the cable does get wet, ensure the cable fully dries out before reconnecting your Starlink.


If your Starlink appears to have lingering connectivity issues after the weather passes, please attempt the following steps:
  * Check to see if your WiFi network has factory reset. Most notably during power outages, your Starlink router may have reset to its default settings. The Starlink router is designed to factory reset after 6 consecutive power cycles, which can inadvertently occur during power outages. If this happens, you can easily set up your WiFi password and network name again using the Starlink app.
  * Check your hardware for any signs of damage, particularly inspecting outdoor components. There's a possibility that debris may have collided with your hardware, potentially causing damage that isn't immediately apparent, or water may have gotten in. If the cable does get wet, ensure the cable fully dries out before reconnecting your Starlink.


If the above steps do not resolve your issue, please contact support.
