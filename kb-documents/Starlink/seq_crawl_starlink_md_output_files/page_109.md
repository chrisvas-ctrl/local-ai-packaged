### Can I exchange my Starlink hardware for another type?
**Please note: Certain Starlink kits are currently unavailable in certain countries.**
If your current Starlink hardware type meets your needs, there is no necessity to purchase an alternative Starlink hardware type. However you may purchase a different Starlink hardware type by contacting Starlink Support. After purchasing a different Starlink hardware type, it will replace your current Starlink's place in the network.
​
  * **Standard Starlink** : Best for residential users and everyday internet applications. Has a built-in kickstand and requires manual orientation of the terminal for setup.
  * **Starlink Mini:** Compact, portable kit that can easily fit in a backpack, designed to provide high-speed, low-latency internet on the go.
  * **Standard Actuated** : Best for residential users and everyday internet applications. Includes a base mount for quick install and has a built-in motor for self orienting.
  * **Starlink Enterprise:** Best for power user and fixed site business applications. Enables installation flexibility with a longer cable, choice of mount included, and ability to directly connect third-party routers and custom setups. If you want to use a Starlink router, this can be purchased separately from Starlink Shop.
  * **High Performance** : Best for power user, business, and enterprise applications. Includes a base mount for quick install and has a built-in motor for self orienting.
  * **Flat High Performance** : Designed for mobility applications and challenging environments. Currently the only designated dish for in-motion use in approved countries with Mobile Priority service or Mobile Priority opt-in data.


​
**Note: Flat High Performance Starlink is only available to be purchased in[certain regions](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=9eb841b3-2e43-a6fb-ecc7-ea58fb5600b5>). If your account country is outside [these regions](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=9eb841b3-2e43-a6fb-ecc7-ea58fb5600b5>), you can use your current Starlink hardware paired with the Mobile Priority data to access prioritized service globally on land and in the ocean while stationary.**
​
**Customers using a Starlink that is not the Flat High Performance Starlink, Starlink Standard or Starlink Mini in-motion do so at their own risk; equipment falling onto the road or off a vessel due to poor installation practices can cause serious accidents resulting in bodily injury or damage to property. Damage to the Starlink while in motion may result in a void of your Starlink warranty. Contact Starlink support to submit a request to purchase an alternative Starlink hardware type.**
