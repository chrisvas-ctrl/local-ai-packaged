### How should I interpret the obstruction map?
_**How long does it take for Starlink to create its obstruction map?**_
About 1 week. Starlink will create a map of surrounding obstructions (e.g. trees, poles, and buildings) as it communicates with satellites over head. 
Starlink's obstruction map will become more accurate as it gathers information over time. It will slowly adapt to changes in its surroundings. For example, if leaves grow on a tree near your Starlink, it will update the obstruction map to include these leaves.
​
_**Will Starlink's performance improve over time as the obstruction map fills in?**_
Yes. As the obstruction map becomes more accurate, Starlink will choose to communicate with satellites in unobstructed parts of the sky when it can.
For best performance, we recommend setting up Starlink with a completely clear view of sky. Obstructions may cause outages when all available satellites are obstructed.
