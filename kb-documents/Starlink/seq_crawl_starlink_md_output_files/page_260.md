### Can I use third-party mounts with my Starlink?
All Starlinks come with a mounting solution, and we offer a variety of additional mounting options in the [Starlink shop](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.com/shop>). We recommend browsing the Starlink shop to find a mount that best suits your installation needs. For detailed installation guidance, check out our [installation videos](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/videos/4>).
While you can use third-party mounting solutions, please note that we cannot guarantee performance or compatibility with non-Starlink hardware. Specifically, third-party metal mounts that wrap around the terminal’s base enclosure, or placing the terminal directly on metal, may interfere with GPS performance and are not supported. 
Third-party mounts with metal near the GPS chip (located at the top right back corner of the Starlink) may affect performance. For optimal performance, we recommend using the Starlink mobility mount.
