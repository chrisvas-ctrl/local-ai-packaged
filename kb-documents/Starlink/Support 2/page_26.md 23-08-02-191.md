### Why can't I change my service plan?

The specific service plans include:
**Starlink Rental option:**
  * Residential customers on the Starlink Rental option may not be permitted to change their service plan. Business customers on the Starlink Rental option may change their service plans to any of the following options: (Priority 40GB, Priority 1TB, Priority 2TB).


**Starlink Financing/Installments option:**
  * Customers on the Starlink Financing/Installments option may not be permitted to change their service plan for the entire duration of the financing term.


**Government Subsidy Programs:**
  * Starlink has partnered with different government entities to offer internet connectivity at a discounted rate for eligible households. Customers on these discounted service plans may not be permitted to change their service plan.


**Disaster Relief:**
