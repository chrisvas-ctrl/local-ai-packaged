### What is an outside region fee?
Starlink Kits activated outside of the region they were originally sold in are subject to an "Outside Region Fee". If you purchased a Starlink Kit from an unauthorized reseller, it is possible that the Outside Region Fee may apply to your order. To avoid this charge, please ensure you are purchasing Starlink from an authorized channel, such as [Starlink.com](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/>) or from an [authorized retailer](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=8a90222d-7c32-edd7-51f6-f696ece07105>) within your region. See applicable fees in USD by region and Starlink Kit type below:
Region of Purchase | Standard Kit & Standard Actuated Kit | Mini Kit  
---|---|---  
1) US/CA | $200 | N/A  
2) Latin America | $200 | $300  
3) Europe | $200 | $300  
4) Africa | $200 | $300  
5) Asia | $200 | $300  
6) Oceania | $200 | $300

Note: The fee may be applied in USD or local currency if supported in your activation country. Based on foreign exchange volatility and local taxes, there may be some variance in the charge applied to your account if you are subject to an "Outside Region Fee".
