### Deposit/Pre-Order - Status and how to confirm my order when it's my turn
Once your area has availability and you are next in line on the waitlist, you will receive an email notification to confirm your Starlink order.
You have 7 days from the "Confirm Your Order" email notification date to confirm your Starlink Kit order. If you do not confirm your order within the allotted timeframe, your deposit will be automatically cancelled and fully refunded.
**I do not have a Starlink**
  1. Visit the "Confirm Your Order" email 
  2. Select to "Confirm Your Order" within the email. You will be directed to log into your Starlink account.
  3. The "Confirm Your Order" section will be visible in the upper right hand corner
  4. Verify the Service Address, Shipping Address, and Payment Method are correct
  5. Select "Confirm Order Now" to complete the process


**I already have my Starlink**
  1. Visit the "Confirm Your Order" email 
  2. Select to "Confirm Your Order" within the email. You will be directed to log into your Starlink account.
  3. Select "Checkout Now" in the "Confirm Your Order" section in the upper right hand corner
  4. Verify the Service Address, Shipping Address, and Payment Method are correct
  5. Select "I already have my Starlink" and enter the Starlink Identifier

Note: To utilize your current Starlink hardware with a different service, you will need to cancel your current service and unlock the hardware. To unlock your Starlink device: Log in to your Starlink account > Select "Manage" > Select "Transfer." This action will disassociate the Starlink from your current account, making it available for use with another service.
