### I am tax exempt based on belonging to a qualifying group, how do I apply?
If you reside in the US or Canada and belong to a qualifying tax exempt group, and your Starlink has been delivered, submit a support ticket with the information below. 
  * **IMPORTANT:** the name on your submitted documentation must match the name on your account, otherwise we are unable to process the exemption.
  * **CANADA:** If you are tax exempt as part of the First Nations tribe, upload a copy of the front and back of a current First Nation ID card.
  * **UNITED STATES:** Please provide the following:
    * Your state’s sales tax exemption certificate and other documentation as required by your state’s Department of Revenue.
    * Government entities, non-profit organizations, businesses, or other non-individual tax exempt bodies: Proof of the payment being made directly by the entity/organization (e.g., purchase order, front and back photo of tax exempt credit card used, signed and dated statement stating that the payment is made directly by the entity/organization, etc).
      * Note: Starlink is unable to process tax exemption requests for government entities, non-profit organizations, businesses, or other non-individual tax exempt bodies under a Residential account. See our [Transfer Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=f3cad923-ed28-f957-365c-787f8fe2e4a2>) helpful support topic to create a new Business account with a business tax ID using your current Starlink equipment.


**Tax refund policy:**
As of July 21st, 2023, the tax refund period has been updated. Starlink will automatically process tax refunds at the time of tax exemption request, per the following guidelines:
  * **UNITED STATES:** Starlink will refund the appropriate taxes paid if the exemption request is submitted within 60 days of your Starlink order date. 
  * **CANADA:** We encourage you to submit your tax exemption directly after you receive your Starlink kit. Starlink will refund the appropriate taxes paid for the last 180 days.


Once your exemption has been validated, the applicable tax amount will be refunded to your original payment method. Please allow up to 15 days for the refund to be reflected with your financial institution.
Starlink reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to reject any exemption request.
