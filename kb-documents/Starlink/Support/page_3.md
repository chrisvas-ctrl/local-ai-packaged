#### Frequently Asked Questions
##### Can I expedite my order?
We are unfortunately not able to expedite the delivery at this time - carriers are actively working to deliver your orders as soon as possible. Please check out the FedEx website to review the active service disruption regarding Hurricane Helene and Milton [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.fedex.com/en-us/service-alerts.html>). 
If mail service is impacted in your area, you may need to order Starlink to a different shipping location that you can receive the Starlink at. If you have not already, please place an order using a deliverable service address and shipping address.
We also recommend visiting your local retailer to quickly find kits like Home Depot or Best Buy. They may or may not have Starlink in stock, so we recommend calling your location or checking online to verify inventory. You can activate retail kits via Starlink.com/activate to access the free service.
​ 
##### How does weather impact my service?
If you are in the path of hurricane-force winds, we recommend the following to minimize potential hardware issues and disruptions to your service:
  * If it is safe to do so, we recommend to bring your Starlink and cables indoors.
  * If you cannot bring your cable inside, protect the exposed ends from water. If the cable does get wet, ensure the cable fully dries out before reconnecting your Starlink.
