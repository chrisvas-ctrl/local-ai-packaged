### How do I cancel service?
**Cancel Service:**
You can cancel your service at any time by following these steps:
  1. Log into your Starlink [Account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>)
  2. Select "Your Subscription" from the "Home" page, then "Manage" next to your Service Plan
  3. Click "Cancel Service"


To cancel an upcoming service plan change, click "Manage" under "Service Plan" box, click "Change Plan", then click "Cancel Upcoming Change".
If you cancel/pause your plan, before the change takes effect, you may resume it by clicking "Resume" in the "Your service plan will end on ..." alert, at the top of the page.
**Note:** Your service will remain active up until the date paid for, and will be removed from future billing cycles. By canceling service, you may not be able to reactivate immediately. Reactivation is dependent on service availability and capacity in your area.
If you are having any issues leading to your cancellation, please reach out to support and we'd be happy to help.
