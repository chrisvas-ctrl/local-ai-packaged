### How do I refer a friend to Starlink?
**Current restrictions:**
  * The referral program is currently only available in Australia, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Mexico, New Zealand, & United States.
  * Referrals will only issue credits to the Residential and Roam Unlimited subscriptions. (No Priority or Roam 50GB services)
  * Referral codes are granted on the account level, not by number of service lines.
  * Kits purchased from a retailer or reseller are not eligible for the referral program. Please note, no credit will be given, even if a referral link was used during activation.


**As a Starlink customer:**
  * You will receive an email inviting you to the referral program. This email will contain your unique link (e.g. <https://www.starlink.com/?referral=RC-XXXXX-XX>). 
  * You can copy & paste this link or share via the Starlink app.
    * In the Starlink app, select the 'person' icon and then "Free month for you and them".
  * If your referred friend makes the purchase through your referral link you will receive a notification via email.
  * 30 days from your friend’s account activation, a service credit will be applied to your account.
  * The service credit will be used to deduct from the total of your next invoice.


To see the number of times or how much service credit has been applied to your account, you can log into your account via web and see the referral section.
**How can I use my referral service credit?**
  * As the Referrer (You shared your referral link): The service credit will be applied to your account 30-days after the person you referred activates their account. Once applied to your account, it will be used to deduct from your next invoice.


**By participating you also agree to the Terms & Conditions noted below:**
  * To qualify for a referral reward, the following must occur:
    * The referred customer is not, nor have they ever been, an existing Starlink customer;
    * The referred customer must purchase a Starlink Kit using the unique referral link provided by you;
    * The referred customer must remain a paid Starlink customer for at least one (1) month after activating the Starlink Kit.
  * This referral program only applies to Starlink's Residential and Roam offerings where Starlink is immediately available. Referred customers in areas listed as “Waitlisted” on the Availability Map are excluded from this offer: starlink.com/map.
  * Starlink may, at any time and in its sole discretion and without prior notice, terminate, cancel, suspend or modify its referral program or these terms.
  * Starlink reserves the right to limit, cancel, delay, or revoke a referral reward if Starlink determines, in its sole discretion, that a participating party has acted in a fraudulent or abusive manner, or if Starlink terminates or suspends a Starlink user account based on a violation of the Starlink Service Terms.
  * You agree to not represent yourself as an employee or agent of Starlink, or as a distributor or reseller of Starlink Kits.
  * You agree to indemnify and hold Starlink and its officers, directors, employees and agents harmless from and against, and assume complete responsibility for all third-party suits, actions, claims, losses, judgments, damages, costs, and expenses arising in connection with your negligence, misrepresentation, fraud, error or omission relating to or concerning Starlink, the Products, or this Agreement.
