### Do I need to sign a contract to use Starlink? 
Starlink offers options for flexible month-to-month service plans without long term commitments. However, in select markets, certain offers may require long term commitments. Once your subscription is cancelled, your service will remain active until the end of the payment period. 
Please note - by canceling service, you may not be able to reactivate immediately. Reactivation is dependent on service availability and capacity in your area. 
For additional questions, please refer to the Terms of Service.
