### What can contribute to high daily data usage?
There are many factors that can lead to a device on your WiFi network consuming a high amount data.
  * **Someone joining your WiFi network:** If you have an open WiFi network (with no password) or an easily guessable WiFi password, people may join your WiFi network and consume a lot of data. To address this, make sure your set a strong WiFi password.
  * **Background updates:** Some devices (such as mobile phones or game consoles) may download large software updates or may update apps automatically over WiFi. Check your device's settings for a "Low Data" mode to limit background data usage over WiFi.
  * **Other updates or large downloads:** Movie downloads and updates to video games can be very large, sometimes over 100 GB.
  * **Speed tests:** Depending on network speeds, each speed test may consume up to ~1 GB or more. Data downloaded and uploaded during speed tests will be counted towards data usage totals.
  * **Devices using excessive data:** There are some cases where certain devices (e.g. smart TV's or security cameras) quietly send diagnostic data to servers in the background.
  * **Devices with malware:** In some rare cases, a device on your network may be infected with malware. This can lead to extended periods of very high data consumption for a compromised device.


Use the Starlink app to identify suspicious devices on your network. Open the "Network" screen and look for any unrecognized devices. You can tap on a device to see how much data it has used in the last 15 minutes.
If you have an open WiFi network or your password can be easily guessed, consider setting a new WiFi password in "Settings."
