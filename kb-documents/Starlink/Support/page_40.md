### My region is at capacity or shows as "sold out" on the availability map. What does that mean?
If your desired service region shows as "sold out" on our [availability map](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/map>), it means that residential service is at capacity and residential service activations are currently not possible. We are unable to provide timelines for residential service availability in any sold out regions. In order to get notified when service availability has capacity again, you must place a deposit for your desired service location. Once your area has availability and you are next in line, you will receive an email notification to confirm your Starlink order. 
Availability for business plans may differ from residential service; you can check on the current availability at your location at [www.starlink.com/business](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<http:/www.starlink.com/business>).
If you already have an account, you can place a preorder by taking the following steps: 
  1. Click the "Subscriptions" tab on the left side
  2. Click "Add Subscription" on the top right
  3. Enter your service address and click "Check Availability"
  4. Place a preorder


If you plan on purchasing your Starlink from one of our authorized retailers, please be sure to enter your desired service address on our [order page](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/>) to ensure availability.
_Note: Service availability is subject to change._
