#### How to access the Disaster Relief service plan
​ 
#### Existing customers
No action is required, as we have proactively applied a one month service credit to your account. You can see the service credit on your account under the billing tab. 
If you are currently cancelled or paused, we have also applied a credit for the amount of your previous service plan, enabling you to reactivate and utilize the service credit during this time period.

#### More details
  * If your Starlink kit has been impacted by the wildfires, please contact support requesting assistance to provide you with a free replacement.
  * If you purchased a kit with this service plan, starting February 10th, we will move you to a paid Residential subscription, tied to the location you are using it in at that time. We will reevaluate as necessary based on conditions in the area. Starlink will notify you as the time approaches to remind you of the change.
  * There may be limitations on the ability to transfer these kits or continue free service outside of the disaster region. More details will be added here as necessary.
  * There are no contracts with Starlink. Starlink kits are under the same 30-day full refund return window. Read more [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/a522bcf2-1e26-981f-1530-c05052fe2b9c>). ​
