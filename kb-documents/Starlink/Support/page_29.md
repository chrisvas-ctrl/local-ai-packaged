  * [Transfer Restrictions:](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<#transfer-restrictions>)

  * [How to Activate Your Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<#how-to-activate-your-starlink>)


#### Important Information Before Transferring Starlink Hardware:
  * **Responsibility** : Starlink is not responsible for the condition of kits sold or transferred by third parties.
  * **Payment** : Ensure all orders and services are fully paid, with no outstanding balance.
  * **Cancel Service** : You must cancel your service to transfer the hardware.
  * **Service Stops** : Once transferred, the Starlink is removed from your account permanently. Service will stop immediately, and any remaining service days will be lost.
  * **New User Sign-Up** : The new owner must sign up for service at [starlink.com](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com>). Availability may vary by region and service type (e.g., Residential, Roam, etc.).
  * **Charges** : The new user will be billed for the first month of service upon activation.
  * **Warranty** : The warranty is based on the original purchase date, even if sold or transferred by a third party. Verify the kit’s condition before purchasing from third parties. Learn more about the warranty [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal/documents/DOC-1133-73441-63>).
  * **Country Compliance** : Starlink kits are certified for specific countries. Certain services may be restricted based on the country of original purchase.


​
#### Transfer Restrictions:
  * Transfers are not allowed until 120 days after purchase or 90 days after activation—whichever comes first. 
  * Transfers are not allowed if the account has an outstanding balance.
  * If you have initiated a return for your hardware, you can transfer your hardware only if the carrier has not yet scanned the label.
  * Starlink Mini cannot be transferred to a Business account at this time.


​
**Important Notes:**
  * If you're having issues transferring your Starlink 120 days after purchase from an authorized retailer, please contact Starlink support with your proof of purchase.
  * We're committed to providing high-speed internet to Nigeria and Mawali and are working closely with regulators to make adjustments that will improve the customer experience. Until these changes are approved, we are placing new Residential orders on hold. Place a deposit now to reserve your Starlink and you will recieve a notification once orders resume.

  * **Dish Serial Number** : Varies by hardware type:
