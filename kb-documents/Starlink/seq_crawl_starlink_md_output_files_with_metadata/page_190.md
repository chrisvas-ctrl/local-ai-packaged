### Where is Starlink Aviation service available?
Starlink Aviation has true global coverage, including over all international waters and with consistently strong signal at high latitudes and in polar regions.
Further, Starlink has authorization to provide in-motion connectivity services to aircraft in [these countries](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=5e433e52-5583-6c37-81a4-426a6478d49c>), including on the ground, during take-off, in flight, and during landing. Please check this country list periodically as it is constantly expanding. (There may be additional requirements or limitations due to local airport rules. Please check with the airport authorities where you operate.)
Beyond this list of approved countries, Starlink service is also operational in flight overland above most countries around the world, with very few exceptions.
