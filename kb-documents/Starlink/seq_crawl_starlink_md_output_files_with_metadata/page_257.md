​
**Getting Connected: If you're using the Gen 3 router with the Starlink Standard Kit, follow the steps below:**
  1. Connect to the STARLINK network from your device WiFi settings.
     * 'STARLINK' is the router's default WiFi network name (SSID).
  2. To secure your Starlink WiFi network, use the Starlink App to rename your Starlink WiFi network and create a WiFi password. Open the Starlink App > Settings > Router > enter desired WiFi network name and password > Save.
     * This step is optional, however we recommend securing your WiFi network. Your Starlink WiFi network is not password protected until you set the password.

  1. You are now connected! To customize additional settings, check your connection, and more, visit the Starlink App.


​
**Below are steps listed to connect a Gen 3 router in combination with a Gen 2 Router in use:**
  1. Ensure your Starlink is set up and connected to the internet prior to setting up the Gen 3 router by connecting to your existing Starlink WiFi network from your device. 
  2. We recommended placing both routers in the same room for the best performance, or to choose a location for your Gen 3 router that is in line of sight of your Gen 2 Router. 
  3. After unboxing your Gen 3 router, plug the router into a power outlet with the power cable and power supply. 
  4. Open the Starlink App and wait 1-2 minutes for the notification: "PAIR NEW MESH NODE", then click "PAIR". The Gen 3 router will begin connecting on the NETWORK screen for about 1-2 minutes. 
  5. Once connected, the Gen 3 Router will appear on the NETWORK screen in the app. The light should be solid white.


​
**Using the Extra RJ45 Ports (Gen 3 Router):**
  1. Remove the RJ45 cover on the back of the router. 
  2. Plug in your own ethernet cable to port 1 or 2. Then connect the other end of your cable into your third-party hardware.


​
**Additional Notes:**
  * A standard RJ45 cable can be used in lieu of the Starlink RJ45 cable; however, it is recommended that the provided Starlink RJ45 cable is used to ensure proper sealing.
  * The latching mechanism inside the Starlink RJ45 port is completely passive and only requires a firm tug to remove the cable. It should be possible to remove both the Starlink RJ45 cable or a standard RJ45 cable just by pulling it.
  * If you install a standard RJ45 cable in the Starlink RJ45 port and cannot pull it out, you can use a small screwdriver or similar tool to depress the tab which should release the cable.
  * Available mounting option in the Starlink Shop: [Gen 3 Router Mount](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/public-files/installation_guide_standard_router_mount%203.pdf>)
