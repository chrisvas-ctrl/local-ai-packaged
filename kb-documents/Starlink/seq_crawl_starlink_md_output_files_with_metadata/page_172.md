### What service plans are compatible with Starlink Mini for aviation use?
General Aviation customers may select one of the two options: 
Supports aircraft ground speeds <100kts, land only (2 months max outside of base country): 
  * Roam 50GB at $50/mo. 
  * Roam Unlimited at $165/mo.


Supports aircraft ground speeds with <250kts, land and ocean:
  * Mobile Priority at $250/mo.


For aircraft flying at any speed, we recommend using one of our standard Business Aviation plans:
  * Business 20Gb at $2,000/mo. (additional data available for opt-in at $100/Gb)
  * Business Unlimited at $10,000/mo.


**Note:** Upgrading service to any of the Business Aviation service plans requires the user to sign the Starlink Business Service Terms at time of upgrade request.
