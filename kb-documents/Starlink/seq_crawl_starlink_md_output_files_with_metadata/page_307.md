### I can't change the Starlink router settings, what do I do?
The time it takes for the bonding between a Starlink router and Starlink terminal can vary. After unboxing the Starlink hardware, some users may see a message stating the router doesn't appear to be associated with the Starlink.
If this occurs: 
  * Confirm your Starlink and mobile device has a stable internet connection and you are logged in to the correct Starlink account.
  * Wait ~30 min for your connection to stabilize and for your router to attempt bonding.
  * If your router still hasn't bonded after 30 minutes, manually reboot the Starlink router to force another bonding attempt and wait up to 1 hour.


If after 1 hour you are unable to establish an internet connection and change the router settings, please contact Starlink Customer Support to further troubleshoot.
