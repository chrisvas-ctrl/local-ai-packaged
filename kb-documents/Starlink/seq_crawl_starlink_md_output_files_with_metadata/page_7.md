### Brazil - Nota Fiscal
Nota Fiscais are sent directly to the email registered on your Starlink account. If you cannot locate your Nota Fiscal email after checking your spam/other folders, please contact Customer Support.
If you need to change the CPF, you can do so by changing the CPF (Tax ID) registered on your account, as long as the information (such as name) pertaining to the CPF matches the information on the account. Once updated correctly, the CPF will reflect onto future Notas Fiscais.
Business is not yet available in Brazil, so it is not currently possible to purchase a Starlink kit with a CPNJ.
