### Will I receive a partial refund if I ordered Starlink before a hardware discount was applied in my area?
Current customers - If you ordered within the 30-day period before a hardware discount (limited time offer) began, please reach out to Starlink Customer Support by submitting a support ticket for further assistance. (If you need help in creating a support ticket, please navigate to [this FAQ](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=bdb63773-e93b-74e8-8e12-2da2fb6d534e>))
New customers - If you are looking to order Starlink, please go to [Starlink.com](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.com>), enter your address, and click “Order now”.
  * If the price matches the discounted price on Starlink.com, you are in an eligible region.
