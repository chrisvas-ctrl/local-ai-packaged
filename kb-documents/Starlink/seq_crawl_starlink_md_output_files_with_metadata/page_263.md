The base that comes with your Starlink is designed to support a ground level installation or a quick setup to test your internet connection. Consider a permanent installation in an elevated location, like a roof, pole, or wall if you cannot avoid obstructions or find a clear field of view from the ground level. Many customers find that a permanent mount provides the best installation and service

A Wedge mount is included with your Starlink Kit purchase. Your Starlink is designed to be mounted at 8Â° on a horizontal surface to help prevent rain or snow build-up. Mounting your Starlink in a vertical position (e.g., on the side of your chimney) will not allow it to operate.
Additional mounts and cable routing accessories are available for purchase on the [Starlink Shop](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.com/shop/>) once your Starlink Kit is ready to ship. While all mounts are designed for self install, please reach out to a roofing or installation professional if you have any questions or do not feel comfortable completing the install yourself.
