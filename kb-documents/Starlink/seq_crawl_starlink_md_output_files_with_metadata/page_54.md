If you receive an email or text requesting your Starlink account email, phone number, password, or payment details, it's likely not from Starlink. Here are some tips to help recognize phishing messages and other scams to keep your account secure.
#### How to tell if a message is from Starlink
Authentic emails will come from the "@starlink.com" email domain without any variations. If the sender's email address comes from anything other than "@starlink.com", it is a scam.
We'll never ask you to share your personal information in a text or email or over the phone. All information required for your Starlink account should only be entered at the official starlink.com website or official iOS and Android applications. This includes:
  * Credit or debit card numbers. Starlink never requires your 4 digit debit card PIN number.
  * Bank account details.
  * Starlink login information.
  * Social Security number or sensitive personal information.
  * We'll never ask for payment through a 3rd party vendor or website.


If the text or email links to a URL that you don't recognize, don't click it. If you did already, do not enter any information on the website that opened.
To verify an email or text's authenticity, you can log in to your account directly at starlink.com/account or [contact us](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/contact?sourceType=web_chatbot_bypass_v2&sourceValue=web_article_help_center%7eedb59e-9c8d-0f34-b40d-37921d0fe98a>).
#### What should I do if a get a suspicious email or text?
Don't click on any links or reply to any messages. Delete the email or text and block the sender.

#### What if I already clicked a link or shared personal information?
  * Delete the email or text and block the sender.
  * [Update your Starlink password](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/a4aed86c-2e2c-2332-02cc-502af08446f1>) to a new one and do not re-use the same email and password combination for any other services. 
  * Contact your financial institution if you entered any payment information. It may have been compromised.


#### What are the best ways to keep my information safe?
  * Do not trust anybody who tries to sell you a prepaid Starlink bundle over the phone. Starlink does not sell prepaid multi-month service plans over the phone or through external websites.
  * Don't click email links. Instead, go directly to the official starlink.com website.
  * Never send personal or financial information through email or text.
  * Inspect the sender's address and verify it is from a "@starlink.com" email address.
