### What is Starlink Mesh?

To purchase Starlink Mesh for your home network, log into your account and visit the [Starlink shop](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.com/shop/>).
In some homes, a single WiFi router may not provide enough wireless coverage, leading to poor performance in certain areas. A Starlink Mesh network extends coverage by placing Starlink Mesh routers between your main router and areas with weak signals. For the best performance, place Starlink Mesh routers 1–2 rooms apart from the primary router.
We do not recommend using more than three Starlink Mesh routers. If your home is larger than 6,000 square feet, Starlink Mesh may not provide full coverage, and you may want to consider a third-party mesh system.
​ 
**Important Notes:**
  * Starlink mesh routers can be purchased to replace a damaged router of the same type.
  * The Gen 3 router is currently only available on the [Starlink shop](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<starlink.com/shop>) in select markets.
  * Gen 1 routers do not support mesh.
