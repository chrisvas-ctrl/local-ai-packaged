You can check service availability for your address using our [availability map](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.com/map>). If the area you’re trying to activate in is at capacity, you can place a deposit when placing an order.

**Limitations:**
  * **IMPORTANT: We recommend downloading and using the Starlink app to activate your kit. You can download the app** [**here**](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/setup>)**.**
  * Standard and Priority plans cannot be activated in capacity-limited areas. You can check Starlink's service availability map on [www.starlink.com/map](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<http:/www.starlink.com/map>). If there is no capacity in the area, there will be an option to activate with a Roam service plan. Please note, you will be unable to switch from a Roam service plan to a Standard or Priority service plan until your area has available capacity.
  * Activating Standard or Roam service plans in an existing Business type account is not supported.
  * Activating a Starlink for use in a different country than the country used upon original account sign up is not supported.
  * Service will not be activated for Starlinks currently assigned to an existing account.
  * If a service plan is unavailable, make sure that your current country is chosen in the country selector.
  * At this time, Brazil and Nigeria accounts are unable to add more than one service line per account.

**Nigeria & Malawi:** We're committed to providing high-speed internet to Nigeria and Malawi and are working closely with regulators to make adjustments that will improve the customer experience. Until these changes are approved, we are placing new Residential orders on hold. Place a deposit now to reserve your Starlink and you will recieve a notification once orders resume. 
​ 
**Retail Purchase Note:** When you purchase a new retail kit, you’ll receive one hour of internet access upon first plugging in your Starlink. This allows you to activate your service and complete the sign-up process even without an existing internet connection. If you exhaust the one hour of access, you can activate your Starlink using another internet source and following the activation steps listed above.
