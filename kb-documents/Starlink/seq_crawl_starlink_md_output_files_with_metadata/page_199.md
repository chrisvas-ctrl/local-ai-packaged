### How can I activate a Starlink using API? 
To activate a Starlink via API follow the steps below: 
  1. POST an address 
  2. GET available subscription products
  3. POST a service line
  4. GET a user terminal ID from the paginated list (ensure this is the exact terminal being used at the address indicated in step 1) 
  5. POST a user terminal ID to the service line


For detailed information, refer to our [readme.io](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/readme.com/>) documentation (<https://starlink.readme.io/docs>). Your account manager can provide a password for access to our documentation.
**Note:** API access is available for Starlink Authorized Resellers or Larger Business/Enterprise Customers in order to manage accounts, user terminals, and service.
