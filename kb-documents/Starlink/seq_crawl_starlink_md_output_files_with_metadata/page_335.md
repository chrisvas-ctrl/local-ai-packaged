### My internet is intermittent (frequent drops)
**Examples that lead to intermittent connection:**
  * Obstructions
  * Installation outside of service address
  * Improper Starlink installation and/or router placement
  * Hardware & cable damage
  * Third-party devices


**Recommended steps:**
**1: Visit the Starlink App and check if any alerts have appeared:**
  * If there are no alerts banners displaying in the Starlink app, proceed to step 2.


**2: Reboot router and confirm if all or some devices are experiencing intermittent service:**
  * If some devices, then move the device closer to the router and see if the issue continues. If continues, proceed to step 3.
  * If all devices, then proceed to step 3.


**3: Inspect hardware for any visible damage:**
  * Check cables for nicks, cuts, and hard bends. If jammed in any doorways and window panes, this can result in degraded service.
  * Check ports for any debris or damage.
  * If no damage was found, proceed to step 4.


**4: Disconnect any third-party hardware in your Starlink setup:**
  * If the disconnections do not continue, then the third-party hardware used in your setup is the root cause for the experienced disconnections. We are unable to guarantee service quality performance with third-party hardware.
  * If the disconnections continue, proceed to step 5.


**5: Confirm the Starlink dish is securely installed where the mast will not sway with the wind:**
  * If the Starlink installation allows for swaying or movement of the Starlink mast, degraded service is expected. Please visit [starlink.com/shop](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.com/shop/>) to view alternative mount options.
  * If the Starlink has a secure installation, proceed to step 6.


**6: Click "Contact Support" to submit a support ticket with the following information:**
  1. If possible, attach clear photos of your Starlink installation, cable routing, router placement, and any other photos you feel may be helpful to resolve your issue.
  2. Is your Starlink power connected directly to a wall outlet? If not, include how you are powering your Starlink.
  3. When do you first recall experiencing the disconnections?
  4. Are the disconnections only present while using specific programs/applications?
  5. Are the disconnections only present during certain times of the day or constant throughout the day?
