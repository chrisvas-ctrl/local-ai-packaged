### How do I ship to a military address, such as an army post office (APO) or a fleet post office (FPO)?
Starlink does not ship directly to APO/FPO addresses. If you do not have a local address to ship to in your country of service, you will need to use a third-party forwarding service that can redirect Starlink shipments to your APO/FPO address for an additional cost. You will need to take the following steps:
  1. Sign up for a freight forwarding service that ships to an APO / FPO
  2. Enter the new U.S. address provided by the freight forwarding service on starlink.com/roam
  3. Select a Roam service plan when checking out
  4. Starlink will ship your order to the new U.S., shipping address and it will then be forwarded to your APO / FPO address


After delivery, you can transfer your Starlink to a local account by submitting a support ticket, where we will need to confirm you've shipped to a military address in an active market.
