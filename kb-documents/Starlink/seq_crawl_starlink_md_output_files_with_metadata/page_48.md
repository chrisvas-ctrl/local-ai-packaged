### How does a service credit get applied to my account for a promotion?
Service credits can be applied to a customer's account by the Starlink team. Customers with service credits will continue to receive monthly billing statements, but the service credit will deduct from the outstanding balance, not exceeding the total amount of the statement. For example, if a customer receives 1 month of service credit, the customer will receive a $0 billing statements for the next cycle.
Please note, service credits are not applied to any immediate transactions or pro-rated costs (i.e. reactivation, plan changes, shop orders). Credits are only applied to monthly subscription charges. The credit card on file for the account will be charged the standard billing rate after the service credit has been applied.
For example, if your invoice is $120 USD when a $100 USD credit is applied to your account, the new balance due for the invoice will be $20 USD. Your invoice will then have a line item that reflects $100 USD of credit has been applied to your invoiced total.
