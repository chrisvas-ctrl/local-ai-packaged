### How do I manage my data?
You can track your monthly data usage and manage your service plan from your account page on Starlink.com or from the Starlink app. Please make sure your Starlink app is on the latest app version in order to access the latest Starlink app features.
For plans with Local Priority or Global Priority data, you can also view progress toward your monthly data limit and opt-in to ensure you automatically receive additional Local Priority or Global Priority data upon exhausting your data limit in a given month. Additional data is charged in blocks in increments of 50GB, at the cost specific to your service plan as described in Starlink's [Fair Use Policy](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal>), until you choose to opt-out. Your additional purchased data will be displayed and charged on your next monthly invoice. 
**Important Notes:**
  * Data tracking is in UTC time and may be delayed by several minutes. Refer to your statement for the most accurate information.
  * Third-party routers and networking devices may track data usage differently than Starlink. Differences can result from the types of network traffic a third-party router tracks, how it measures overall data usage, and the intervals at which it records data.
  * Starlink software updates and health checks do not count toward your monthly data usage.
  * Starlink calculates total data usage based on all bytes sent to and received from each Starlink.
  * The Starlink router does not track per-device usage. We are unable to provide breakdowns of data consumption by individual devices.
