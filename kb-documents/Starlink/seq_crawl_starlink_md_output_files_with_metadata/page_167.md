### Does Starlink offer a program to exchange my current Starlink kit for a newer version?
Starlink does not offer an exchange program to upgrade to the newest kit version. 
However, customers can transfer service or may recieve a partial refund when returning a Starlink kit. Transferring your kit allows you to give away or sell it, while returning it under the conditions specified can qualify you for a partial refund.
