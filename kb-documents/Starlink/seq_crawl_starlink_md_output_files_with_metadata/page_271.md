### Can I use my own router with the Starlink Mini?
Yes, you can use your own router with the Starlink Mini and connect via the ethernet port to a Mini Starlink Cable available on starlink.com/shop or your own ethernet cable. To disable the integrated Starlink Router, refer to these instructions for [enabling router bypass mode](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=a0fe8d51-32f7-d2b9-d74a-801e31ad9f6a>). 
Note: This product is no longer rated IP67 with a standard RJ45 cable. Manual factory reset is required to disable bypass mode.
