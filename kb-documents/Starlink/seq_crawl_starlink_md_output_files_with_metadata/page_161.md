### What is the Starlink family discount?
Starlink offers a family discount that allows customers to add additional subscriptions to their account with discounts on the Starlink Kit and/or monthly service prices. This plan is only available to select Residential customers in the United States, Colombia, & Argentina, by invitation.
Once invited, to purchase a family discount subscription, select the "+" on your account page, select "Residential" service, then select the "Family Discount" as your hardware option and proceed to checkout. You can allow others to manage the shared account by adding them as additional users. Steps to add users are listed [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=b33da5ba-46f4-c93a-5cbb-700edae91188>). All subscriptions will be billed together on your account's billing day of the month.
Restrictions:
  * Each account is limited to 2 total subscriptions
  * A new user must be added for each additional subscription on the account
  * To maintain eligibility for a discounted service plan, you must continuously subscribe to a full-price service plan. If you cancel the full-price service plan, the discount will be immediately removed from a family subscription.
  * You may not change the service plan of a discounted subscription for 6 months
