**Notes:**
  * The Gen 1 router is only compatible with the Standard Circular Starlink Kit. 
  * Enabling bypass mode through the Starlink App is not supported. The included Starlink router can be removed and replaced with third-party equipment.
  * Gen 1 routers do not support mesh


**The light on your router is the status:**
  * **Pulsing White:** Connecting/Updating
  * **Solid White:** Connected to Internet
  * **Solid Red** : Not Connected


**Getting Connected**
  1. Connect to the STARLINK network from your device WiFi settings.
     * 'STARLINK' is the router's default WiFi network name (SSID).
  2. To secure your Starlink WiFi network, use the Starlink App to rename your Starlink WiFi network and create a WiFi password. Open the Starlink App > Settings > Router > enter desired WiFi network name and password > Save.
     * This step is optional, however we recommend securing your WiFi network. Your Starlink WiFi network is not password protected until you set the password.
