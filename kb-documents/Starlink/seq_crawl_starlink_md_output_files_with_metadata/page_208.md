### Why can't I see my Starlink(s) on the dashboard?
Starlinks **not** attached to a service line (active or inactive) will not be visible from the drop down of the search bar on the dashboard.
**Note:** Starlinks linked to inactive service lines will appear when the “All Service Lines” box is selected – this does not include inventory that has **not** yet been assigned to a service line. 
To view this inventory, you’ll need to activate a service line and the Starlink will populate in the drop down for selection as it is currently unassigned.
