### What is the Starlink "Residential Lite" service plan?
_(Currently only available in select areas)_
Starlink "Residential Lite" Service is a more affordable service plan for personal or household-use at a fixed, land-based location in select areas. Users will have an unlimited amount of deprioritized data each month with no long-term contracts.
This service plan will be deprioritized compared to Residential service during peak hours. This means speeds may be slower for Residential Lite service relative to Residential service when our network has the most users online.
​
**With the Starlink "Residential Lite" Service Plan:**
  * There are no data caps and no speed caps
  * Speeds should range from 50 - 100 Mbps (as compared to 150 - 250 Mbps for the Residential service plan)
