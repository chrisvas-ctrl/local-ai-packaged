### How can Starlink Business and Maritime customers order more than one Starlink?
To add an additional service location to your account, you can place another Starlink order, as availability permits, by clicking + in the "Your Starlinks" section of your account, [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>).
You can individually add Starlinks to your cart using the "+" and check out in bulk once all locations have been added. Starlink Business customers have access to an unlimited number of service locations.
