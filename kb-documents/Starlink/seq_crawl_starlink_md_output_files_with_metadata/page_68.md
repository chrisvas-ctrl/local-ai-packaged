###  Why did I receive a "Payment Scheduled" email?
Your monthly service bill has generated in your Starlink account. Starlink sends a "Payment Scheduled" email the day your monthly service payment is automatically withdrawn from your account to pay for the following 30 days of service. Ensure your account payment method is up-to-date before your scheduled payment due date.
  * For Mobile Money payments, you will need to log into your account every month on the Payment Due Date to complete your payment.
  * You can preview your monthly invoice in your Starlink Account for the next monthly service invoice from your account at any time.
