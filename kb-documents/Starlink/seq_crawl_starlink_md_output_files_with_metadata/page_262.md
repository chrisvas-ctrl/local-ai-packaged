### Are there RV mount options?
Flat High Performance Starlink kit includes a Wedge mount that is suitable for installing on RVs and other vehicles. 
While the Standard Starlink does not have mounts specific for RVs, we recommend browsing through the Starlink shop ([starlink.com/shop](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.com/shop>)) to see if any of the alternative mount options meet your install needs.
