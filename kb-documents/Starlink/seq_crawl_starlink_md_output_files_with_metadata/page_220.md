### What happens when I reach my data limit for Priority Plans?
With a Local or Global Priority plan, you have a limited allocation of data. If you run out of data, and are not currently "opted-in" for automatic top-ups of data or you do not purchase any one-time blocks, you will receive data that operates with speeds of up to 1 Mbps download and up to 0.5 Mbps upload. This data is usable anywhere you are able to use your Priority Data. 
Note: Starlink terminals that are operating on Unlimited Data (at speeds of up to 1 Mbps download and up to 0.5 Mbps upload), & Top-up with additional priority data, may take up to 10-15 minutes for Priority speeds to resume.
