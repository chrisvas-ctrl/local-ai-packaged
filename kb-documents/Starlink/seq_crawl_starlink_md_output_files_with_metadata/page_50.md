### Mobile Money - Payment Method
**Ghana, Kenya & Rwanda Customers Only:**
Mobile Money payment option allows you to use your mobile device's digital wallet to complete Starlink purchases. Using the phone number listed on your account, Mobile Money will send a one-time passcode to your mobile device to complete the payment. Please ensure the phone number that is listed on your account, matches the phone number registered with your mobile device's digital wallet.
For monthly service billing, you will be required to log into your account on the Payment Due Date to process your payment.
  * To avoid service interruptions, ensure to pay for the service on the Payment Due Date. For more information visit [Starlink Terms of Service](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal>).


For Starlink shop orders, select 'Mobile Money' as your preferred form of payment prior to placing your order.
  * If the transaction was not successful, you can either (1) Cancel the order and re-order using Mobile Money as your payment method or; (2) Pay the outstanding order balance with the default payment method on file.
