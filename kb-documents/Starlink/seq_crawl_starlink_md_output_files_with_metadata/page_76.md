### Why did I receive a "Payment Failed" email?
You will receive a "Payment Failed" email each time a payment is not successfully processed, which sometimes contains advice on what the issue is and how to resolve. We will automatically retry the payment three times over the next 14 days after initial failure. During this time your service will not be impacted. If after 17 days you still have a subscription balance, your service may be turned off. 
Make sure your billing address is up-to-date, your banking information is correct, and your account has sufficient funds.
To retry the payment with a new payment method:
  1. Click the "Billing" tab in your [account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>)
  2. Click the pencil icon next to your payment method.
  3. Enter your new payment details. 
  4. Once you have authenticated your payment information, click "Make a Payment" and your payment will process.


If you are still unable to successfully process your payment, we recommend contacting your financial institution for further assistance.
