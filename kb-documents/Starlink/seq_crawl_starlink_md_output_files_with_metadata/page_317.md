### How do I run a speed test?
You can run a speed test with the Starlink app. By default, speed tests in the app measure the speed between your router and the internet. This is great for evaluating how your service is performing, and how much bandwidth is available to all the devices on your network. This won't take your current device's WiFi connection quality into account.
Results may vary between tests as network demand changes and different satellites become available.
**Download** | **Upload** | **Latency**  
---|---|---  
Higher speeds mean less buffering and faster file downloads. | Higher speeds mean faster video uploads, and file transfers to the internet. | Lower numbers mean less lag in games and video calls.  
**Advanced** The Starlink app provides two advanced speed test options:
  * Device to Internet - Measures end-to-end speeds from your device running the Starlink app and the internet. This test uses a similar methodology to other speed test providers, and factors in your device's WiFi connection.
  * Device to Router - Measures the connection quality between your device and your Starlink router. If this number is lower than your router speed test, you may be bottlenecked by your WiFi connection.
