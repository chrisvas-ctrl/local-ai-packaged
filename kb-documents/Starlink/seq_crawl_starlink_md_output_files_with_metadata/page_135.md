### My address is correct. Why am I getting a message saying it is incorrect?
When you place an order, it undergoes various validations to ensure a smooth delivery process. If our systems detect a potential issue or if your order reaches the out-for-delivery stage but we cannot locate your address, we may require additional information from you.
These errors can encompass anything from an incorrect postal code to our carrier's inability to reach your location. To resolve these issues, we will contact you, explain the problem we've identified, and request your assistance in rectifying the situation so we can get your order to you as quickly as possible.
Please respond to the message we've sent, with the requested information. Your prompt response will help us get your order on its way to you as soon as possible.
