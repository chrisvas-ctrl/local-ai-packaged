Some regulations restrict the use of certain wireless channels to indoor use only. If your Starlink router is operating outdoors, enabling the Outdoor Mode will configure your router to comply with these regulations.(Note: This feature is only available to customers with a Starlink account created in Japan. Please see below for the details on the applicability for each kit type.)
#### Standard Kit / Standard Actuated Kit
To change your router's configuration to Outdoor Mode from the Starlink App:
  1. Connect to your Starlink WiFi
  2. Sign into your Starlink Account on the Starlink App
  3. Go to Settings
  4. Click on Advanced
  5. Under Outdoor Mode, you can toggle ON the switch
  6. Your router should now be set to Outdoor Mode and the configuration will remain until you toggle OFF the switch or if you factory reset the router.


#### Mini Kit
  * In Japan, Starlink Mini defaults to "Outdoor Mode" - enabling Dynamic Frequency Selection + restricting certain channels, to adhere to Japan's Radio Law. This means that no action is required in order for the Mini dish to remain compliant.
