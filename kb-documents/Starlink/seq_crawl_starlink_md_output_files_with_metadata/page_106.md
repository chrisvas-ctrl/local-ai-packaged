### How do I order Starlink for Business in Singapore?
Currently the only available Starlink service in Singapore is Starlink Business. Starlink can only be ordered and shipped in select regions. To place an order, please visit <https://www.starlink.com/business> and input a shipping address to order Starlink. 
Customers placing Starlink Orders for use in Singapore are required, by the Info-communications Media Development Authority of Singapore (IMDA), to apply for and hold the ‘Satellite Communication Station Licence (Portable Satellite Communication Terminal Licence)’ and to pay an annual license fee of SGD 50 per station. Apply via the GoBusiness Licensing Portal: <https://licence1.business.gov.sg/feportal/web/frontier/home>.
