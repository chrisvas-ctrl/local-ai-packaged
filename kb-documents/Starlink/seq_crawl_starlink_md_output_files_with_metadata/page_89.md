### How do I request an electronic invoice (e-invoice) from Starlink El Salvador? 
You can request your e-invoice or electronic invoice to include the tax information reflected in your Tax ID Certificate from the Ministerio de Hacienda (e.g., Legal Name, NIT, Address, Zip Code) for physical orders and subscription services you have purchased from Starlink.
For this, you need to send your tax information to Starlink by following the options listed below depending on your desired e-invoice.
**Important:** You must follow the steps below within 90 calendar days from the date of your first Starlink Kit order. If you do not send your tax information to Starlink within such 90 calendar days, your e-invoices or electronic invoices will only be issued with the updated information going forward (no past invoices will be corrected).
**How do I submit my tax information?**
**Important:** Please create a support ticket and include your legal name and tax information as stated in or reflected in your Tax ID Certificate, this must match the full name or legal entity entered on your Starlink account.
To receive End Consumer E-Invoices (Factura de Consumidor Final) please include the following information:
  1. Legal name
  2. NIT, DUI or Passport
  3. Address


**Why am I receiving historical e-invoices that correspond to prior months?**
Starlink is issuing all historical e-invoices (from February, March, and April 2024) in May and while these invoices may be sent all at once please note that this not intended to charge or collect any amount you. 
For historical e-invoices generated, the 90 day period will start to be counted from May. **All historical e-invoices will be dated with May’s date (and onwards).**
**How will I receive my E-Invoices?**
Your e-invoice or electronic invoice (both PDF and XML files) will be sent automatically to the email registered on your Starlink account, directly from avdmail@avdinternacional.com. We cannot send e-invoices to multiple emails at this time.
  * You can only request invoices be corrected if within 90 calendar days from the date of your most recent Starlink Kit order within the fiscal year. Starlink will not correct e-invoices from previous years. 
  * All invoices are provided digitally. We do not support physical (paper) invoices.


**Important:** Per our Terms of Service: Supplemental customer support for business or government specific requests (e.g., modified invoicing or tax-exempt certifications) are only available under Starlink’s Priority Service Plans and may not be supported under Residential Service Plan subscriptions.
**What do I do if my invoice did not include my tax information?**
Please send your tax information (NIT/DUI/Passport) so that it can be updated, original orders that do not include your information can be corrected/regenerated if you request this before 90 days from you initial kit purchase. Please submit a support ticket and include your tax information as well as the order that needs to be updated. 
**What do I do if I need to change my tax information again after I submit my initial information?**
If your tax information has been updated (i.e., you moved and your postal code on your tax documentation has changed), then we can update your tax information. Please follow steps above to submit a support ticket and mention that the information on your tax identification has been updated and provide the documentation with this change (if applicable).
