### What is Starlink?
Starlink is a satellite internet provider enabling high-speed, low-latency broadband internet in remote and rural locations across the globe.
Starlink enables video calls, online gaming, streaming, and other high data rate activities that historically have not been possible with satellite internet.
Starlink is ideally suited for areas where connectivity has been unreliable or completely unavailable. People across the globe are using Starlink to gain access to education, health services and even communications support during natural disasters.
