Benefits beyond Standard include:
  * Better visibility of satellites. Your Starlink needs a clear view of the sky so it can stay connected with satellites as they move overhead. The Flat High Performance has the widest field of view which can see 35% more sky and has enhanced GPS capabilities, allowing it to connect to more satellites and better serve mobile users.
    * Better performance on boats: The Flat High Performance has the best network experience and more uptime due to the wider field of view so it is able to stay connected to passing satellites when the vessel rolls or rocks on the water.
  * Permanent installation for your vehicle. A Wedge Mount is provided for an 8 degree tilt on the installation to help with water run-off. Standard comes with a built-in kickstand.
  * Better performance in hot weather. Download speeds are typically 3x better at > 35°C (95°F).
  * Better performance in the snow: 1.7x better snow melt capability (Inches/hour).
