###  Are there any differences with installing a Flat High Performance vs the Actuated High Performance?

While performance and integration are largely the same, there are a few differences to note when installing the Flat High Performance dishes:
  * The Flat High Performance dish requires a Wedge Mount for every installation, which is supplied in the contents of the kit.
  * The Flat High Performance kit comes standard with the 25m cable.
  * Some fixed site installations may benefit from using a Flat High Performance Pipe Adapter in combination with the Wedge mount. Flat High Performance Pipe Adapters are available for purchase on the Starlink Shop.
