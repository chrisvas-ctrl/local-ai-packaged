### When will I receive my refund?
  * If you cancel a deposit, the refund is processed immediately. However, it may take up to 10 days within the U.S. and Canada or 20 days outside of these regions for the refund to appear in your financial institution account.
  * Upon returning your Starlink Kit or accessory within the return window, we will process the refund upon receipt and inspection at our facility.
