### How does pause service work?
The option to pause service is available only to Roam and Priority service plans. Other service plans have the option to cancel service, and in most areas can be reactivated later.
**How to pause service via website:**
  1. Log into your account on starlink.com
  2. Select "Subscriptions" and then select the service line you want to pause
  3. Select "Manage" in the Service Plan box
  4. Click "Pause Service". If the option to pause does not appear, then your service plan does not support it. However, in most cases cancel and reactivate serves as a pause (subject to service availability upon reactivation)


**How to un-pause/resume service via website:**
  1. Log into your account on starlink.com
  2. Select "Your Subscription" from the "Home" tab, then "Manage" next to your Service Plan
  3. Select "Manage" in the "Service Plan" box, then click "Activate Plan"
  4. Select your desired available service plan, then click "Continue"


**Important notes:**
  * If you pause your service before the end of your current billing period, you will still receive service for the remainder of your billing period. When you un-pause your service, the monthly subscription fee will be charged immediately, on a pro-rated basis dependent on the plan monthly cost and time remaining on your pre-determined account billing cycle.
  * Starlink subscriptions billing is tied to UTC time, so **changes need to take place ahead of your billing day at 12:00 AM UTC** in order for them to be accounted for in the latest billing run. 
  * Any **changes made after midnight will be delayed** until the following instance of the billing day, which will be 12:00 AM UTC for the billing day next month.


**For the first invoice:**
  * You can pause service prior to activation in order to not be billed for the first invoice. You can pause service through your Account page (via starlink.com) once your Starlink has shipped. Subsequently, the first bill will generate when you un-pause/reactivate your service. For more information on when activation occurs, visit [this FAQ](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=6f4bf543-476c-c0c2-166c-485756acea90>).


**What happens if I cancel or pause my service after my billing day/invoice generated?**
  * If you cancel or pause after your billing day/invoice generated, you'll still be responsible for that month's invoice. Your service will continue until the end of the current billing cycle.
