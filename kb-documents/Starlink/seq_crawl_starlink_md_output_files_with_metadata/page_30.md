### How do Enterprise accounts transfer Starlinks?
You can transfer Starlinks on your account via the Starlink "Manage" page. There are two parts to the transfer process:
**Note:** To successfully unlock, Starlinks must first be removed from any service line. Once unlocked, there Starlinks can be added by anyone who has the Starlink identifier
Part 1: If applicable, ensure Starlink is removed from any Service line
  * Ensure Starlink you wish to unlock has been removed from any service line using the instructions contained in [“How do I remove a Starlink from a service line using the dashboard?”](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=64512fd5-e3f9-6148-d238-8b254c9b16be>)
  * Navigate to the Starlink terminal's "Manage" tab
  * Select "Remove Starlink" button
  * Select "Remove" on the pop up window


Part 2: Unlock
  * The current account must "Unlock" the Starlink from their account
  * Navigate to the recipient account's Dashboard Tab
  * Select "Add & Unlock Starlinks"
  * Select "Unlock Starlinks"
  * Input the Starlink(s) you would like to unlock from the account
    * You may input a single identifier or input a comma seperated list of up to 20 Starlink identifiers
  * Select "Unlock Starlinks"


Part 3: Add
  * The current account must "Add" the Starlink to the account
  * Navigate to the recipient account's "Dashboard" Tab
  * Select "Add & Unlock Starlinks" 
  * Input the Starlink(s) you would like to add to your account
    * You may input a single identifier or input a comma separated list of up to 20 Starlink identifiers
