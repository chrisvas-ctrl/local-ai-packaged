### How do I refer a friend to Starlink?
**Current restrictions:**

  * Referrals will only issue credits to the Residential and Roam Unlimited subscriptions. (No Priority or Roam 50GB services)
  * Referral codes are granted on the account level, not by number of service lines.
  * Kits purchased from a retailer or reseller are not eligible for the referral program. Please note, no credit will be given, even if a referral link was used during activation.


**As a Starlink customer:**
  * You will receive an email inviting you to the referral program. This email will contain your unique link (e.g. <https://www.starlink.com/?referral=RC-XXXXX-XX>). 
  * You can copy & paste this link or share via the Starlink app.
    * In the Starlink app, select the 'person' icon and then "Free month for you and them".
  * If your referred friend makes the purchase through your referral link you will receive a notification via email.
  * 30 days from your friend’s account activation, a service credit will be applied to your account.
