### Can I add additional Starlinks to my account?
**Customers based in Brazil, Nigeria, and Yemen are unable to add more than one line of service per an account at this time.**
​ 
To add an additional service location to your account, you can place another Starlink order as availability permits. To place an additional order, go to the "Subscriptions" tab of your Starlink [account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>) and click "Add Subscription" on the top right [account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>) or open the "Shop" tab and select "Order another Starlink". 
  * Each additional location requires the purchase of a Starlink and Starlink subscription.
  * There is a limit of 8 kits for Residential accounts.
    * As of 7/2/24 customers with Residential accounts are unable to purchase additional kits once reaching the 8 kit limit.
    * If you had 8+ kits prior to 7/2/24, your kits will remain unaffected by this change.
  * There is no kit limit for Business accounts.
  * If the new area does not have service availability, you will have the ability to place a deposit for that location.
  * You cannot add a location in a different country.
  * You can view Starlink's service availability map on [starlink.com/map](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/map>).
