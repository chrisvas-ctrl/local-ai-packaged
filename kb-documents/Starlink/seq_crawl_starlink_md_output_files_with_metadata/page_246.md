### Check for obstructions
To set up your Starlink, find a location with a clear view of the sky so it can stay connected with satellites as they move overhead. Objects such as a tree branch, pole or roof, that obstruct this connection between Starlink and the satellite, will cause service interruptions. 
Use the following steps to check for surrounding obstructions:
  1. Go to the location where you'd like to set up Starlink.
  2. In the Starlink app (iOS, Android), select “Check for Obstructions”
  3. Follow the guided experience to scan Starlink's field of view using the camera and estimate how obstructed your chosen location is. The phone should be held as close as possible to the height and perspective of Starlink.
  4. Repeat as needed in multiple locations.


The 'Check for Obstructions' tool in the app will show you what is in your Starlink's field of view, in addition to providing you an overview of the expected experience for various activities.
For users in heavily obstructed areas, we recommend checking for obstructions following above steps prior to ordering Starlink, to assess your field of view.
For best performance, cable protection and long-term reliability, we recommend to permanently install Starlink. Click [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/videos/5>) for additional installation guidance.
