### If I cancel service as a business account, when will it end?
Once service is cancelled via API, the "endDate" for service cancellation is set to the day before the next billing day of the month. This ensures you are not billed for the cancelled service line in the next billing cycle. 
The "serviceEndDate" reflects when the Starlink will stop receiving service - this should be set to the day before the billing day of the month. 
API access is provided to larger business customers to manage accounts, user terminals, and service.
