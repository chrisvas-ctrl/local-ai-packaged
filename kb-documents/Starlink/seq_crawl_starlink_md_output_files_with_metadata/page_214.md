### How do Starlink Business customers receive invoices?
Invoices are accessible at any time from your Starlink account. To view or download invoices, follow the steps below: 
  1. Login to your Starlink account
  2. Navigate to the "Billing" tab
  3. Click through the pages for all records of your statements
  4. Select the download arrow to download invoices. 
     * Residential and Business customers can download a PDF to view their invoice. 
     * Enterprise customers can select either PDF or CSV as the format to download. (PDF will give the official invoice with bank details. CSV can be useful when trying to understand service line data usage for a large invoice.)


  * Statements will be emailed each month automatically to the account's main user(s). At this time, we are not able to email invoices to a specific user on a Starlink Business account. To ensure invoices are delivered to desired users, verify all users have been added to the account.


**Adding business Tax ID and other information on Invoices:**
  * Business accounts:
    * Your invoice's business information and Tax ID will match the information entered during initial account sign up.
  * Residential accounts:
    * We do not support the ability to add business information including business Tax ID information on your invoices. 
    * You can create a business account at [starlink.com/business](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/business>) using the same email address as your Residential account, and enter your business's information during the Business account sign up. Starlink hardware, services, and other purchases made on your Business account will have an invoice with your business information.
