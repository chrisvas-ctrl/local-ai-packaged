### Can I use Starlink on the ocean?
Global Priority data is required for ocean use.
The Global Priority service plan enables our fastest network speeds for consumers, can be used on the ocean and land, and is available in customizable blocks of data. For information see [Starlink Maritime](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/us/business/maritime>).
If you are on the Roam Unlimited service plan you will need to opt-in to Global Priority data to use Starlink on international waters.
