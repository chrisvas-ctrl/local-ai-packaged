**2. Find A Clear View of Sky and Check for Obstructions**
Your Starlink needs a clear view of the sky so it can stay connected with satellites as they move overhead. Objects that obstruct the connection between your Starlink and the satellite, such as a tree branch, pole, or roof, will cause service interruptions. Use the obstruction tool in the App to ensure you have selected a suitable mounting location. Click here for video guidance on obstructions.

**3. Install Mount**
Using your desired Starlink mount, install in an elevated location, like a roof, pole, or wall. Additional mounts and accessories are available for purchase on the Starlink Shop

**4. Connect and Align Starlink**
Follow the cable routing instructions for your chosen Starlink mount and plug one end of the Enterprise Cable into your Starlink. Ensure the plug is fully inserted such that the plug face is flush with the surface. To remove the cable, pull firmly outward as there is no release tab. Plug the other end of the Enterprise Cable to your Power Supply.

Connect the Ethernet Cable to the power supply and the other end to a router.
If you have a Starlink router, continue the install process on the Starlink app. Once connected, an alert on the app will show if you need to rotate Starlink to be properly aligned. Click the alert to use the alignment tool. See [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/ec11895c-bf17-f4fe-5d17-bbbfc0b2a906>) for additional guidance on the alignment tool. 
If you have a compatible third-party router, follow the router's set up instructions.
**5.Connect to WiFi**
  1. If you're using a Starlink router, find and connect to the STARLINK network in your device's WiFi settings.

  2. You are now connected! Open the Starlink app to customize additional settings, check your connection, and more.
