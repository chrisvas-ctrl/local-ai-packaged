### How do I request an electronic invoice (e-invoice) from Starlink Colombia? 
You can request your e-invoice or electronic invoice to include the tax information reflected in your Tax ID Certificate “Formulario de registro unico tributario o RUT” (e.g., Legal Name, NIT, Zip Code) for physical orders and subscription services you have purchased from Starlink. 
For this, you need to send your tax information to Starlink by following either method listed below.
**Important:** You must follow the steps below within 90 calendar days from the date of your most recent Starlink Kit order. If you do not send your RUT/tax information to Starlink within such 90 calendar days, your e-invoices or electronic invoices will only be issued with the updated information going forward (no past invoices will be corrected). 
**How do I submit my RUT information?**
**Important:** Your legal name and NIT stated in your support ticket or reflected in your Tax ID Certificate (RUT) must match the full name or legal entity entered on your Starlink account.
To send your tax information, please submit a support ticket and attach your Tax Certificate (Formulario del Registro Único Tributario or Cedula). If you attach a Cedula, please provide us with your Complete billing address (Municipality, City, Postal Code).
**How will I receive my E-Invoices?**
Your e-invoice or electronic invoice (both PDF and XML files) will be sent automatically to the email registered on your Starlink account, directly from avdmail@avdinternacional.com. We cannot send e-invoices to multiple emails at this time.
**Note:** You can only request invoices within 90 calendar days from the date of your most recent Starlink Kit order within the fiscal year. Starlink will not correct e-invoices from previous years. All invoices are provided digitally. We do not support physical (paper) invoices. 
**Important:** Per our Terms of Service: Supplemental customer support for business or government specific requests (e.g., modified invoicing or tax-exempt certifications) are only available under Starlink’s Priority Service Plans and may not be supported under Residential Service Plan subscriptions.
**What do I do if I need to change my tax information again after I submit my initial information?**
If your tax information (RUT) is updated (i.e., you moved and your postal code on RUT changed), then we can update your tax information. Please follow steps above to submit a support ticket and mention that the information on your RUT has been updated and provide the documentation with this change (if applicable).
