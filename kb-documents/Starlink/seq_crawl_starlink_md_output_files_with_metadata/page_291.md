### Can I use a network switch with Starlink?
Yes, you are welcome to connect your own equipment to Starlink. However, we cannot guarantee Starlink performance or compatibility with third-party networking devices.
For customers with Standard (Circular) Starlink, connect the network switch via the AUX port on the Starlink router or third-party router LAN port. We do not recommend or support placing network switches between the power supply and the router. Do not connect the switch to the white port on the power supply.
For customers with Standard Actuated Starlink, a Starlink ethernet adapter is required to connect a network switch. Do not enable bypass mode. Bypass mode is designed to support third-party routers and will only provide one IP address.
