### Change Shipping Address in Starlink Checkout
Before completing your order in the Starlink shop:
  1. Select the "pencil icon" next to "Shipping Address".
  2. Enter new shipping address.
  3. Save change by selecting "Update Shipping Address"


The entered shipping address will only apply to this order and does not change your account's default shipping address.
