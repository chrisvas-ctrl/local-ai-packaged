### What is the Starlink Service Level Agreement?
For our Local Priority and Global Priority plans, we are committed to providing 99.9% uptime in each complete billing period, considering all outages that last longer than 1 minute.
  * For a Starlink that fails to reach 99.9%, we will credit 20% of recurring line and data fees for that billing period.
  * Applies to all Standard, High Performance, or Flat High Performance Starlinks on Global Priority and Local Priority plans. In the case of a service line with multiple terminals, the amount credited for each failing UT will be 20% of the total recurring service line and data fees for that service line divided by the number of UTs on the service line.
  * Does not apply to Starlink terminals on data pools.
  * Valid globally where Starlink service is active.
  * Valid only when the Starlink is powered on with an unobstructed view of the sky.
  * Valid for Standard Starlinks when properly aligned (<5 degree error) or Flat High Performance Starlinks when tilted less than 20 degrees.
  * Not valid for outages that occur when UT is in power save sleep, performing software update, or using rate limited service in excess of data allowance.
  * Starlink automatically detects qualifying outages, which can be viewed in your account. In case of an outage not detected by the terminal, user must submit a support ticket within 14 calendar days of the outage including precise UTC time period and nature of the outage. Starlink will review and apply credit if appropriate.
  * For purposes of the SLA, an outage is defined as a period where the Starlink is unable to send/receive pings to/from servers at a Starlink Point of Presence.
