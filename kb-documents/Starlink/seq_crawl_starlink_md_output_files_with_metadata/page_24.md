### How do I change my service plan as an Enterprise customer?
For Enterprise customers, once the service line is active, you can change the service plan using the dashboard or API.
To update the product of a service line via dashboard follow the steps below:
  1. Log into your account on Starlink.com
  2. Navigate to dashboard tab > select "Manage"
  3. Under the "Service Plan" box, click "Change Plan"
  4. Select the desired service plan. By switching service plans, you are accepting the terms and conditions of the new service plan.


To update the product of a service line via API follow the steps below:
  1. GET available subscription products
  2. PUT the updated product onto the desired service line


For detailed information, refer to our [readme.io documentation](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.readme.io/password?redirect=/docs>). Your account manager can provide a password for access to our documentation.
**Note:** API access is provided to larger business customers to manage accounts, user terminals, and service.
**Change to higher priced plan:** Access to the upgraded service plan will be immediate and you will be charged the higher price starting on the day you upgrade the plan. Your monthly invoice will reflect the difference in the pro-rated monthly price for the upgraded plan and the remaining days of your billing cycle. 
**Change to a lower priced plan:** Your current service plan will remain the same for the remainder of the billing cycle. Access to the downgraded service plan will take effect at the start of your next billing cycle. If there are any overage charges that accrued under the previous and new service plans, you will be charged for them in the invoice for the next billing cycle. You will be charged the lower monthly service price for the downgraded service plan at the start of your next billing cycle.
**Change to a plan priced the same:** Access to the service plan will be immediate. Pricing reflected on the monthly invoice will remain the same.
**Pausing or cancelling a service plan:** A service plan that is paused or cancelled will remain active until the end of the current billing cycle. If that service plan is later reactivated, it will be pro-rated similar to a newly created service plan. 
**Local Priority and Global Priority data consumption:** Increasing monthly data will take into effect at the start of your next billing cycle. Top-Up data charges will be reflected on the invoice for the following monthly billing cycle, including applicable taxes. Unusued Top-Up Data does not rollover to the next monthly billing cycle. Unused Top-Up Data will not be refunded or credited.
