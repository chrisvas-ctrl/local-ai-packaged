### How do I log in to the Starlink app?
Steps to log in via the Starlink app:
  1. First, make sure you have downloaded the latest version of the Starlink app from the [App Store](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/apps.apple.com/us/app/starlink/id1537177988>) or [Google Play Store](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starlink.mobile>). The latest version of the app often contains bug fixes for common issues.
  2. Make sure that you are using a well-supported web browser.
     * On iOS, go to the device's settings and navigate to Safari Settings. Make sure that Safari is selected as the Default Browser App.
     * On Android, we recommend installing Chrome and making sure that it's set as the device's default web browser.

     * On iOS, navigate to Safari settings and tap "Advanced". Make sure that "JavaScript" is toggled ON.

     * On iOS, navigate to Safari settings and tap "Advanced". Make sure that "Block All Cookies" is toggled OFF.
     * If something went wrong when logging in to the app, please make sure you have third party cookies enabled, you're using a supported browser like Chrome or Safari, and your browser is not blocking redirects.
  5. Make sure the device's operating system time is correct and set automatically.
     * On iOS, navigate to settings, then go to General > Date & Time and make sure that "Set Automatically" is toggled ON.
     * On Android, navigate to settings, then go to "Date & Time" (location may vary) and make sure that "Set time automatically" is toggled ON.
