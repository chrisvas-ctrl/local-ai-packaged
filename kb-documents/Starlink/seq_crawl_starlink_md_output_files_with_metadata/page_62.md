### My refund was processed to an inactive card. What do I do?
Depending on your bank, if the account that the card was attached to is still active, the refund will still be successful. This also applies if the card has been reported lost or stolen. If it has been 15 business days and you have not recieved your refund, please reach out to Support for further assistance.
