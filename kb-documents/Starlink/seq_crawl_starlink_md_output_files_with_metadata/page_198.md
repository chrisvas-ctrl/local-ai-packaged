### How is the Telemetry API data different from the "Network Statistics" data in my portal? 
The data in the Starlink Dashboard is aggregated and displayed for predefined intervals in a chart. The data shown in the dashboard may be slightly different from the Telemetry API data because of the aggregation method.
The Telemetry API is designed for near-realtime continuous small-batch requests (i.e. polling) for users that have their own data infrastructure to monitor Starlink devices separately from the Starlink dashboard.
