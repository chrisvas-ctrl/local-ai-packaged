### My bank account has been cancelled/closed. How can I receive my refund?
To request a refund to a different bank account, please reach out to the bank of the closed account to obtain an official letter confirming the account closure. Open a support ticket and attach the letter. 
In order for the letter to be considered, please make sure the letter has the following. If any information is missing, the investigation will be denied or delayed. 
• The letter needs to be printed on bank letterhead, with customer information, signed and stamped. 
• The letter must state: a) Account has been closed b) Refund has been rejected
If you are unable to provide a letter, please reach out to Customer Support for further assistance. Please be prepared to provide the details of the new account (bank name, account number and routing number). 
Note: The process to investigate a refund without an official letter from the bank will take 3-4 weeks.
