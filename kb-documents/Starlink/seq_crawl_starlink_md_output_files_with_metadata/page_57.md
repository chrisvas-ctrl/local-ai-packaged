### If we leave a credit card as our selected payment method on our account, will that card be charged for each invoice as it becomes due, or the total account balance?
Invoices are charged to the payment method on your account as they become due. If a carryover balance remains on the account from previous invoices, the balance will be added to current monthly statements. Those statements will charge the credit card on the account when they become due.
