The Starlink Gen 3 WiFi router offers improved performance and range over the Gen 2 router. It features a WiFi 6 chipset for faster speeds and better performance in congested environments, as well as Tri-band radios for enhanced mesh performance. The router includes two ethernet ports, an LED indicator, a factory reset button, and comes with a Starlink cable, power cable, power supply, and water-resistant port covers.
If your current speed is limited by your WiFi signal, the Gen 3 router can help improve speeds with its enhanced range and WiFi 6 capabilities. To check your speed, use the advanced speed test feature in the Starlink App, which shows both the speed of your connection to your router and the speed of your Starlink connection. You will want to test several areas around your home as the strength of your WiFi signal can vary greatly depending how close you are to the router.
