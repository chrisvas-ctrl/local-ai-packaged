### Why do I need a clear field of view to use Starlink on the ocean?
Your Starlink needs a clear view of the sky so it can stay connected with satellites as they move overhead. Objects that obstruct the connection between your Starlink and the satellite, such as a tree branch, pole, or roof, will cause service interruptions. Use the Starlink App ([iOS](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/apps.apple.com/us/app/starlink/id1537177988>), [Android](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.starlink.mobile>)) to check for obstructions and find the install location that will deliver the best service.
Many customers find that a permanent mount in an elevated location, like a roof, pole, or wall, provides the best installation and service.
