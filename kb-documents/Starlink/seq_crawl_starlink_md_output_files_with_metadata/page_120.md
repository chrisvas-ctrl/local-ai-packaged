### How do I return my damaged Starlink hardware?
If your Starlink hardware has been replaced at no cost under the [Starlink Limited Warranty](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal/documents/DOC-1133-73441-63?regionCode=US>) coverage, please use the prepaid return shipping label sent to the email address on file to drop off your Starlink hardware for return. Failure to return the replaced hardware will result in a charge equivalent to the cost of the replacement hardware. 
  1. You will receive a pre-paid return label via email, please check if your spam folder and search the email subject "Your Starlink Return". You can also re-download your return label via desktop (not available on app) on your Order Summary page by clicking the three dots on the right side next to "Return Initiated". If you have any issues finding your return label please reach out to support.
  2. Re-box the hardware. 
     * If you no longer have your original box, you can wait for your replacement kit to arrive in order to use the new box for return. (If you decide to use the new box for returning your replaced Starlink hardware, please ensure to remove or cover the serial number. Failure to do this could result in issues with your return.)
     * If your Starlink will not stow, or will not fit in the original box, you can use a bigger box to return your Starlink.
     * **Important:** Please only return your Starlink equipment. Do not include any other items.
  3. Drop it off at the carrier listed on your return label
  4. Once dropped off with the carrier, the Starlinks information will be removed from your account.


**Important:** Only use the return shipping labels for the exact product it was issued for. Using the shipping label to return a different product can result in accidental loss of service and/or charge for not returning the product. If you need a new shipping label, please contact Starlink Customer Support.
