### Starlink shop does not have the item I need. What do I do?
Starlink offers the ability to purchase most hardware from the Starlink shop, however there are some items that may only be ordered by Starlink Customer Support when there is a need for a replacement such as:
  * Power Supply AC Cable
  * Router AC Cable


Additionally:
  * Verify that the appropriate hardware is selected.
  * Parts not sold separately: Gen 3 POE Injector
  * Gen 2 Mesh Router can be purchased from the Starlink shop to replace your Gen 2 main router if needed.
  * We recommend visiting your local hardware store in the case additional parts for installation accessories such as grommets and bolts are needed.
