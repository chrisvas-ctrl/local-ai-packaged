### Why is my tracking information not updating? 
For most regions, tracking details are typically refreshed every three business days. If you haven't observed any progress on your order within this timeframe, please initiate contact with your carrier to inquire about any updates or the cause of the delay.
You can find the contact details for your carrier [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=c954e904-6c7b-0171-e845-567390f8bfb1>), as their name will be indicated in your tracking information. If your carrier cannot provide an update and there has been no tracking activity for three or more days, please contact Starlink Support.
**Note:** For Brazil, it may take up to five business days without updates before taking further action.
