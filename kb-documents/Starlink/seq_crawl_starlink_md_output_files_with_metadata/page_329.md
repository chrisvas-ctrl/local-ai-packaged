### Starlink Mini - WiFi Troubleshooting
If you're having issues with your WiFi connection, go through the troubleshooting steps below to help root cause.
​
**Mini WiFi Troubleshooting**
  1. Run an Advanced Speed Test from the Starlink App (App > Speed test > Advanced Speed Test) both inside and outside of your home. Screenshot the results after each test. If device to router speeds are lower than router to internet speeds, proceed with the following steps to improve WiFi performance.
  2. Make sure your Mini is centrally located with respect to the most common usage areas in your home. A few things to note:
     * WiFi performance is best underneath and behind the Mini.
     * The maximum coverage we expect from the integrated Mini router in a single story home, centrally located on your home's roof, is up to 112 m2 (1,200 ft2).
     * Metal roofs, concrete and brick interior/exterior walls can adversely impact WiFi coverage and range.
  3. Split your network band to create separate 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz networks. This can improve compatibility for devices that don't support 5 GHz connections. (Starlink App > Settings > Click Network Name > Toggle on Split 2.4/5 GHz networks)
     * 5GHz performance is expected to be better when closer to your Mini
     * 2.4GHz may be better when farther from your Mini, in low-congestion environments
  4. If speed is much worse inside or your home's construction and/or size is suspected to be the root cause, consider hardwiring a router or adding an additional router(s) to your network, available on starlink.com/shop.


​
**Using Mesh or Third-Party Router:**
If you want to set up a mesh system with a Starlink router, you can hardwire a router via an ethernet cable into the RJ45 port or create a wireless mesh network. You can also use your own router via the RJ45 port in bypass mode. 
To hardwire a router to your Mini:
  1. Remove the Starlink Plug.

  1. Plug the Mini Starlink Cable available on starlink.com/shop or your own ethernet cable into the ethernet port. Connect the other end of your cable to a Starlink Gen 3 router or third-party hardware.


Note: Use the Mini Starlink Cable available on starlink.com/shop to protect your dish against water ingress. The Mini is no longer IP67 rated waterproof with a third-party RJ45 cable.

  1. If you're using a third-party router, use the Starlink App to put the integrated WiFi router into bypass mode. Manual factory reset is required to disable bypass mode.


To wirelessly mesh a Starlink Gen 2 or Gen 3 router to your Mini, please refer to [How do I setup Starlink Mesh?](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=e729e467-6572-99c0-1035-cdd61b2e2cb7>) for more information.

**Can't Get Online?**
  1. Open the Starlink App to check for any alerts, outages, or obstructions.
  2. Check the status light on the back of your Starlink.
     * **Slow Blinking:** Powered on.
     * **No Light:** No power to Starlink.
     * **Fast Blinking:** LED will blink quickly for 3 seconds while holding down the reset button, then LED will turn off as your Starlink reboots.

  1. Make sure everything is securely and fully plugged in and there is no damage to hardware or cables.
  2. Power cycle your Starlink by unplugging from power and then plugging back in.
  3. Factory reset the Starlink by locating the reset icon on the back. Press down firmly until you hear or feel a click and hold for 3 seconds. The LED will blink quickly and shutoff when complete. Step through the install process to set up your Mini and get online.


Note: Your network name and password will be reset after completing factory reset. Look for 'Starlink' network during setup and configure your network to your preferred network name and password.
