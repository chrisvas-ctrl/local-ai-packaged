### How do I request an electronic invoice (CFDI) from Starlink Mexico?
You can request your CFDIs (e-invoice or electronic invoice) to include the tax information reflected in your Tax ID Certificate “cédula de identificación fiscal/CIF” (e.g., Legal Name, RFC, Zip Code, Tax Regime) for physical orders and subscription services you have purchased from Starlink Mexico. For this, you need to send your CIF information to Starlink Mexico by following either method listed below.
**Important:** You must follow the steps below within 60 calendar days from the date of your Starlink Kit order. If you do not send your CIF to Starlink Mexico within such 60 calendar days, your CFDIs will be issued under “Publico en General” and Starlink Mexico will not be able to update your tax information on such CFDIs, but only on future ones that are issued from when your CIF is received.
**How do I submit my CIF information?**
**Important:** Your legal name and RFC stated in your support ticket or reflected in your Tax ID Certificate (CIF) must match the full name or legal entity entered on your Starlink account.
In order for invoices to generate with your tax information, please follow the steps on your Starlink account to submit your tax information accordingly.
**How will I receive my CFDIs?**
Your e-invoice or electronic invoice (both PDF and XML files) will be sent automatically to the email registered on your Starlink account, directly from avdmail@avdinternacional.com. We cannot send e-invoices to multiple emails at this time.
**Note:** If you purchased your Starlink Kit prior to 6/22/23, you have until 8/22/23 to request a CFDI with your tax information. We are unable to amend CFDIs issued in 2022.
**Important:** Per our Terms of Service: Supplemental customer support for business or government specific requests (e.g., modified invoicing or tax-exempt certifications) are only available under Starlink’s Priority Service Plans and may not be supported under Residential Service Plan subscriptions.
**What do I do if I need to change my tax information again after I submit my initial information?**
Once your CFDI is issued with your tax information, it will be considered final. Starlink Support will not be able to cancel, edit or reissue previous CFDIs. If your Tax ID Certificate (CIF) is updated (ex: you moved and your postal code on CIF changed), then we can update your tax information. Please follow steps above to submit a support ticket and mention that the information on your CIF has been updated.
