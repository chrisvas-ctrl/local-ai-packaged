### What areas are considered land vs ocean under the Priority plans?
**Land** : All areas labeled as "Available", "Waitlist", or "Coming Soon" on the Starlink Availability Map are considered land regions. Local Priority plans can be used on land within the country in which your account is registered, while Global Priority plans can be used on land anywhere Starlink has service around the world.
**Ocean** : Ocean areas are colored as black on the Starlink Availability Map, including islands, unless they are labeled "Available", "Waitlist", or "Coming Soon". Only Global Priority Data can be used on the ocean. Use in local territorial waters is contingent on government approval.
  * Note: Marinas, coastlines, and inland bodies of water are colored as black, however service is available for stationary use.
