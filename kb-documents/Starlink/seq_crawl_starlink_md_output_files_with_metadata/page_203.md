### How do I activate my Starlink/service line using the dashboard?
You can activate your Starlink or add a service line using the Starlink [dashboard](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/dashboard>). Log into your Starlink account, select the "Dashboard" tab and click the "â˜°" sign to "Add a Service Line". Input the requested information.
You will need to specify the service line nickname, subscription type, service address and Starlink serial number. Please note that allowable subscription products must be pre-loaded to your account by customer support or your account manager.
**Note:** If your service address is based on positional coordinates, enter the plus code as the service address. Steps to determine a plus code below 
  1. Copy positional coordinates + paste into Google
  2. Click on the map
  3. Copy the indicated plus code 
  4. Paste into service address field in the "Add Service Line" box in the dashboard
  5. Select option from the drop down


Once these steps are complete, your Starlink will be active. You will be billed for the associated subscription on your next bill.
You can review and manage your new service line in the "Dashboard" tab under "Manage". The "Manage" option allows you to remove/add a Starlink and deactivate/cancel a service line.
