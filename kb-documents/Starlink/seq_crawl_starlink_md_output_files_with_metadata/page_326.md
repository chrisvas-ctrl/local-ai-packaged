### Starlink Mesh Issues
Make sure to follow all the steps in ‘[How do I set up Starlink Mesh?](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=e729e467-6572-99c0-1035-cdd61b2e2cb7>)’. For additional details, refer to the [Starlink Mesh Install Guide](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/public-files/Starlink_Mesh_Installation_Guide.pdf>).
If the “PAIR NEW MESH NODE” notification doesn’t appear in your Starlink App within ~2 minutes of plugging in the new node, try the following:
​
**Your Starlink routers may not be ready to pair a connection.**
  * Make sure your primary router has completed set up and is connected to Starlink.
  * Factory reset your Starlink Mesh router. This will allow it to join the Mesh network.


​
**Your mesh router may be too far away from your primary Starlink router.**
  * Try finding a closer location to your primary router to complete the pairing process.
  * The Mesh nodes work best when connected directly to the primary Starlink router. Place your Starlink router in a central location.


​
**You may have connected directly to the Starlink Mesh router's "STARLINK" network instead of staying connected to your primary router's network.**
  * Do not connect directly to your mesh node's new "STARLINK" network after plugging it in. Stay connected to your original Starlink network and open the app.
  * It may help to rename your original Starlink network something unique to verify that you stay connected to your original network throughout the process.


​
**You may have a non-standard Starlink setup.**
  * Starlink Mesh routers are only compatible with the router included in the Standard (Rectangular) and High Performance Starlink kits.
  * The router included in the Standard (Circular) Starlink kit and third-party mesh systems are not compatible with Starlink mesh nodes.


​
**You may be using an outdated version of the Starlink app.**
  * Update your App if there is an update available.
  * Try uninstalling and reinstalling the Starlink App


​
**You may have too many Starlink Mesh routers.**
  * If you have more than three mesh nodes, your mesh network may experience worse performance. We recommend starting out with pairing just three mesh nodes to the main router, since more than three can complicate the setup and lead to wireless issues.
