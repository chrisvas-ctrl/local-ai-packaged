### What happens if I use Starlink Roam / Mobile service in a different country than my shipping address?
If you use Starlink Roam / Mobile Service in a country different from your shipping address for over two months, Starlink may require you to update your registered address to your new location. If your new location is not in an authorized territory (marked "Available" or "Waitlist" on the Starlink map), your service may be immediately suspended. See [Terms of Service](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal>) for more information.
