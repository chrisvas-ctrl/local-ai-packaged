### What information should business accounts include when paying by wire?
Wire transfer information is located at the bottom of each Invoice. Please note that the sender is responsible for paying any fees associated with the transfer.
When completing a wire payment, please include the Invoice Number(s) that are being paid in the wire notes. To further ensure your payment is applied timely and accurately, please send bank remittance details to the e-mail address provided by your account manager. If paying multiple invoices with a single wire transaction, remittance details must be sent.
