### Is there a delay from when I exceed my overages to when it is reported? 
Yes, there is a delay. If you are opted-in to receive additional data prior to exceeding the limit, the overages during the delay will count as eligible data subject to being billed. If you are opted-out of receiving additional data prior to exceeding the limit, the Standard or Priority Mobile data consumed during the delay will not count as eligible data subject to being billed.
