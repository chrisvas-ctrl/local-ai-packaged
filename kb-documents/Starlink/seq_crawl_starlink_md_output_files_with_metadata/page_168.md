### What is the recommended Starlink Kit for my service plan?
As you change service plans, you are currently allowed to bring your existing hardware with you. Starlink Kits are allowed to access _most_ Starlink service plans. If you are looking to purchase a different Starlink Kit, see the topic - [Can I exchange my Starlink hardware for another type?](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=b1e8a524-52da-3521-4b3f-6f719c83f043>)
