### Service Activation Charge (Including Pause & Reactivation)
If you purchased a Starlink Kit through a retailer or third-party, and you activate service as a new account via [starlink.com/activate](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/activate>), you will be charged for the upcoming month of service immediately.
If you are reactivating service or adding a purchased Starlink through a retailer or third-party on your existing account, you will be charged a pro-rated cost dependent on the plan's monthly cost and time remaining on your existing billing cycle.
