### Billing - Unknown Charges
You can view your complete invoice and payment history in the [billing tab](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/billing>) of you Starlink account. **For customers with multiple Starlink accounts, please check all other accounts to attempt to match the charge amount.**
**When investigating a charge, please make sure to download and review recent invoices in the "Invoices" table. You can download an invoice by clicking the download arrow on the right side of the table.**
Invoices contain important information including the date of the invoice, the payment due date, the service period, the amount and quantity of each subscription / item as well as any applicable taxes. Invoices also show the total amount that has been paid, the total amount to which credits have been applied, and the total amount remaining.
If you do not recognize the transaction on any of your accounts, please check if any of the following cases apply before reaching out to Starlink Customer Support to further investigate:
  1. Check your email inbox for email notifications from Starlink. Starlink sends an email for every transaction made on your account, including no cost warranty hardware replacements:
     * **Payment failure notice:** A failed payment's balance will carry over to the following month's invoice.
     * **Charge for additional Starlink notice:** If you received a no cost Starlink kit replacement, but did not return the damaged hardware, Starlink reserves the right to charge for the cost of the replacement hardware.
     * **Service Activation/Reactivation/Un-pause:** After adding or reactivating a Starlink on your account, you are charged a prorated cost.
  2. Monthly charge for Starlink that is un-installed or powered off:
     * Monthly service fee is not dependent on use. If you have a Starlink Mobile or Mobile Priority service plan, you have the option to pause service & billing for the months you will not using Starlink internet.
  3. Data Opt-In/GB (Priority or Mobile Priority):
     * Once you elect to opt-in to automatically receive additional data surpassing your service plan's monthly allowance, your monthly invoice will show the quantity of GB used within your billing cycle and the associated cost.
