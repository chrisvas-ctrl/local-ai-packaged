### My tracking number says my order has been delivered, but I did not receive it. What do I do?
Double check that the order shipping address is correct in your [account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>) page.
**Wrong address:**
  * If you have access to the delivery address, please attempt to retrieve the package.


**Correct address:**
  * Check with relatives, friends, or neighbors that could have had possibly held on to your package until you were present at the property.
  * Contact the [delivery carrier](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=c954e904-6c7b-0171-e845-567390f8bfb1>) to check if they have delivered your package to a nearby pick up center or to a third-party carrier to complete the delivery.


Click [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=1335007f-82df-2eae-2266-42cbd8f93655>) to find your tracking number from the Starlink App.
If your delivery carrier is FedEx, please reach out to [FedEx Customer Support](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.fedex.com/en-us/customer-support.html>) to submit a claim for your Starlink Order. After you have received the claim number from FedEx, please submit a Starlink support ticket (& attach your FedEx claim number) indicating that you have not received your order although the tracking number says it has been delivered.
Please note, certain orders placed together may be sent in separate shipments. For instance, the Ridgeline Mount Kit will have its mount shipped separately from the ballasts. Please review your [account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>) for an alternative tracking number for the rest of your order.
