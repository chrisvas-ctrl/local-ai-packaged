### My aircraft is going under maintenance, can I pause my subscription? 
You can pause your service at any time with any of the Roam, Mobile Priority or Business Aviation service plans; the pause will be effective after the last day of your billing cycle. 
You can manage your service plan, view data usage, etc., via the Starlink Customer Portal.
