_**Important to note: Although the Starlink cable conforms to RJ45 standards, we do not recommend modifying your cable or combining it with another cable to add length as we cannot guarantee the quality of service. Additionally, the Starlink cable provides a water-resistant protective seal with a locking mechanism, and is power rated specifically to the Starlink kit, therefore we do not recommend using any third-party cables as it may cause water damage to your Starlink.**_
_**Any damages to your Starlink kit caused by the above may void your Starlink warranty. Use at your own risk. We advise you to check out the Starlink shop for additional cable length options that might be better suited for your Starlink setup.**_
