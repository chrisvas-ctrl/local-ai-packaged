### What is the 'Defer Software Updates' feature?
Enterprise and Business customers have the ability to configure their Starlink terminal for deferred software updates. When this feature is enabled, the reboots for software updates are deferred by 3 days. You can proactively reboot your terminal at a convenient time, or Starlink will automatically reboot after 3 days (between 2-4 AM local time). If this feature is not enabled, Starlink will automatically reboot after 24 hours (between 2-4 AM local time). The service line configuration must be set to "Defer Software Updates" before a software update is triggered. If the 24-hour update banner is showing, that update will occur in the normal 24-hour window, but the configuration will apply to future software updates.
To change this configuration, go to the service line page and Configure the terminal. In the bottom right of the configuration screen, toggle the "Defer Software Updates" button to on. This configuration must be set on each service line. 
If you have a service line where service availablity is critical, you can take the following steps to ensure you have the maximum time to plan and coordinate the software update.
  1. Enable the 'Defer Software Updates' feature to increase the notification window to 3 days
  2. Configure a proactive alert for software updates to be notified of when the software update is pending.
