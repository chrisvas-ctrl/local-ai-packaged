### Can I expedite the shipment of my order?
You can find the estimated ship date in the order details page found on your [Account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>) page, or from the Starlink App. This is the most accurate indication on shipment timelines. We will also share updates via. email if anything changes.
Unfortunately, we do not have any premium service or other means to expedite your order. If your estimated shipping timeline continues to push out multiple times please reach back out. Once your order ships, you will receive tracking information via. email and can also find the same on your order details page.
