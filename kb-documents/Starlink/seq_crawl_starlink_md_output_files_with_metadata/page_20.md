### Change Shipping Address on Account
**Account Default Shipping Address:**
  1. Login to your Starlink [account.](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>)
  2. On the left-hand side of your home screen, select the "pencil icon" next to "Default Shipping Address".
  3. Enter new shipping address.
  4. Save change by selecting "Update Shipping Address". Updating your account's default shipping address does not change the shipping address for existing orders.


For future orders, you can either update your default shipping address in your account or you can enter a different shipping address at the time of shop checkout. 
Shipping address restrictions
  * Shipping your items to a country different than the service address used at sign up is not supported. This applies to all Starlink service plans. This requires an account created in the desired country.
  * Shipping address requirements vary by region. 
  * Some carriers can't deliver to certain address types (ie P.O. Boxes are not supported in some countries)
