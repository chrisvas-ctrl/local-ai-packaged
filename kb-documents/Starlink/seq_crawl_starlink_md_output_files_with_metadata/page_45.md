### How do I use a referral link?
**Current restrictions:**
  * The referral program is currently only available in Australia, Brazil, Chile, El Salvador, Mexico, New Zealand, & United States.
  * Referrals will only issue credits to Residential and Roam Unlimited subscriptions. (No Priority or Roam 50GB services)
  * Referral codes are granted on the account level, not by number of service lines.
  * Kits purchased from a third-party, retailer or reseller are not eligible for the referral program. Please note, no credit will be given even if a referral link was used during activation.


**As a new user:**
  * After clicking the referral link, you will be sent to starlink.com. You will see a banner on the top of the page stating that you are using a referral link.
  * Enter your service address next to "Order Now" button.
  * You will be taken to the order page, where you will see the cost break down and a form to input your shipping and billing information. Under the total you will see a bubble of text that will say:
    * If ordering for Residential or Roam services: "Referral Code Applied"
  * Click "Place Order" and you will be taken to a Starlink Order Confirmed page.
  * On the same day, you will receive an email acknowledging the referral link and informing you that the credit will be applied 30-days after activation.
  * 30 days after activation, you will get a notification via email that credit has been applied to your account.
  * The credit will be used to deduct from the total of your next invoice.
  * You will separately receive an email inviting you to the referral program, and your unique link to share with friends and family.


**How can I use my referral credit?**
  * As the Referee (You signed up using a referral link): The credit will be applied 30-days after you activate your account. The credit will be automatically used to deduct from your next invoice. Due to the activation being a part of ensuring the referral is legitimate, you will need to pay for the first month.
