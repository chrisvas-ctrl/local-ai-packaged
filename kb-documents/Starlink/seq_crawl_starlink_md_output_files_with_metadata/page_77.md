### My monthly service cost has changed or is incorrect.
There may be a few reasons why your bill has changed. If you have:
  * Recently received your Starlink kit and have questions about your first bill, see this article: [How monthly service billing cycle works](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=6f4bf543-476c-c0c2-166c-485756acea90>)
  * Recently changed your service plan type, refer to this article: [How do I change my service plan?](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=903869c7-4eff-bf52-76c8-2af222799734>).
  * Opted-in to additional Priority or Mobile Priority data and surpassed the included data amount of your service plan, the charge will be on the following bill. This may cause your bill to be higher than previous months. 
  * Reactivated or added an additional Starlink service to your account, you may have received a prorated charge.
  * Paused service, see this article for information on how billing works when you pause: [How does pause service work?](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=37bb3b47-9525-7224-5f0a-6d016ce26975>)
  * Ordered Starlink as part of an active promotion
  * Had a recent payment failure, the balance will carry over to the following month's invoice.
  * Starlink may adjust prices over time to reflect market conditions resulting in a decrease or increase of the monthly service plan cost. For more details on why your bill may look different, please check your email inbox for email notifications from Starlink.
