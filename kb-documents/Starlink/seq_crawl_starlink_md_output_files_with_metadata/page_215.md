### How do I install my power supply unit to prevent overheating?
For best power supply performance, ensure the power supply is mounted in a location that provides adequate cooling.
When your Starlink is operating at full capacity, the power supply can dissipate 30-40W. To keep your power supply cool, ensure the power supply has adequate ventilation to allow the heat to disperse. 
If you want to install the power supply in an enclosed space, we recommend thermally tying the power supply to the enclosure so it can thermally conduct heat outside of the closure.
The power supply on your Starlink kit contains internal safety features that will shut off the power supply if the temperature gets too hot. Proper ventilation of your power supply is key to preventing unintended network drops due to thermal limitations of the power supply.
