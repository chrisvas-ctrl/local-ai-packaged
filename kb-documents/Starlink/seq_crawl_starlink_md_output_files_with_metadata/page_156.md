### Additional FAQs regarding Priority and Mobile Priority service plans
**We are in progress of migrating customers to our New Local and Global Priority Plans. The below FAQs apply to customers still on priority and mobile priority plans.**
**How do I manage my data?**
You can track your monthly data usage and manage your service plan from your account page on Starlink.com or from the Starlink app. Please make sure your Starlink app is on the latest app version in order to access the latest Starlink app features.
For plans with Priority or Mobile Priority data, you can also view progress toward your monthly data limit and opt-in to ensure you automatically receive additional Priority or Mobile Priority data upon exhausting your data limit in a given month. Additional data is charged on a per gigabyte basis, at the cost specific to your service plan as described in Starlink's [Fair Use Policy](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal>), until you choose to opt-out. Your additional purchased data will be displayed and charged on your next monthly invoice. 
Important Note:
  * Data tracking is in UTC time and may be delayed by several minutes. See your statement for the most accurate info.
  * Some third-party network devices may average data usage over a sample period of seconds and show a different result than your actual data usage. Starlink software updates and health checks are not included in your monthly data usage.


​
**What are the differences between data?**
Priority and Mobile Priority are both given network precedence over Standard and Mobile Data, however only Mobile Priority Data supports in-motion use on land and open water (ocean). 
Mobile Data is always deprioritized behind Standard Data.
​
**How do I opt-in to additional data?**
For service plans with Priority or Mobile Priority data options, you can opt-in or opt-out at any time from your Starlink account page. Roam 50GB, Roam 5GB, and Roam 20GB service plans can opt-in for additional Roam data.
How to opt-in to additional data:
Website:
  1. Log into your account on Starlink.com
  2. From the Home page click the "Subscriptions" tab on the left side
  3. Click on the Subscription you would like to opt-in to additional data with
  4. Then select the Additional Data "Priority", "Mobile Priority", or "Roam" toggle


Starlink App:
  1. Make sure you are logged into your account on the Starlink App
  2. Select the 'Person" icon
  3. Select "Data Usage"
  4. Select the "Priority", "Mobile Priority", or "Roam" toggle


How it works:
  * You can opt in to ensure you automatically receive additional Priority, Mobile Priority, or Roam data upon exhausting your data limit in a given month. Once you opt-in, you will be automatically billed for data used above your plan's allotment until you opt-out, including in following billing cycles. Additional data is charged per GB used. You can track your monthly data usage in your account. Your additional purchased data will be displayed and charged on your next monthly invoice. Your bill may show less data than reflected in your Data Tracker, as we subtract data used by backend Starlink operations (i.e. software updates). If your service is currently paused, you must activate service to see the toggle.


​
**Can I use Starlink on the ocean?**
Mobile Priority data is required for ocean use.
The Mobile Priority service plan enables our fastest network speeds for consumers and can be used on the ocean and land, and is available in 50GB, 1TB, and 5TB plans. Order now from [starlink.com/boats](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/boats>).

**If you exceed the allotted data on your Mobile Priority plan and have not opted in to additional Mobile Priority data, you will be unable to access the internet while on the ocean except to access your Starlink account.** You will continue to have unlimited Mobile service on inland coverage (e.g., lakes, rivers). Opt-in to automatically purchase additional Mobile Priority Data by the GB to maintain connectivity on the ocean at our fastest network speeds.
