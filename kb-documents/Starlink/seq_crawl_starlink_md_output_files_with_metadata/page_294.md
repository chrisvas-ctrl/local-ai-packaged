### Can I add a third-party router or mesh system?
You can replace the Starlink router with a third-party router. To do this, simply connect the third-party router behind the Starlink router and use the Starlink app to enable bypass mode. Please note, we cannot guarantee performance or compatibility with third-party networking equipment, and some features of the Starlink app may not work as expected with a third-party router. For detailed instructions on using the Starlink app with a third-party router, click [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/27802782-944e-10aa-bc29-23ccbc1fce73>).
​
**Important Notes:**
  * For Gen 2 Starlink routers, an ethernet adapter is required and can be purchased from the [Starlink shop](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<starlink.com/shop>).
  * If you have an Enterprise, High Performance, or Flat High Performance kit with an included power supply, you can directly replace the Starlink router with your third-party system.
  * Starlink Mesh is available for purchase on the [Starlink shop](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<starlink.com/shop>).
