### What do the statuses on the dashboard mean? 
The dashboard within your portal shows statuses next to your service line(s). These indicate the current state of the associated service line(s).
Possible statuses include: 
  * **"Inactive"** - Indicates the service line has been deactivated and the end date has passed. Inactive service lines will remain on the account indefinitely. If you need to reactivate a service line, please reach out to customer support. Alternatively, you can remove the Starlink assigned to this service line and create a new one. 
  * **"Ending MM/DD/YYYY"** - Indicates the service line has been deactivated and the end date has not yet passed. 
  * **"Paused"** - Indicates if a service line is currently paused. 
  * **"Deposit"** - Indicates if a particular service line is in a deposit status (Note: this status may also appear if there is an active service line in your account that does not have a Starlink assigned).


**Note:** Starlinks linked to inactive service lines will appear when the “All Service Lines” box is selected – this does **not** include inventory that has not yet been assigned to a service line. To view this inventory, you’ll need to activate a service line and the Starlink will populate in the drop down for selection as it is currently unassigned. 
Starlinks **not** attached to a service line (active or inactive) will not be visible from the drop down of the search bar on the dashboard.
