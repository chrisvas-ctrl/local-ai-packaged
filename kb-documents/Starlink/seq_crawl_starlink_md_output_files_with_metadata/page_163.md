### What is a service line? 
A service line represents an association between a service address and a subscription. A Starlink must be assigned to a service line to be considered active and to receive service.
Most Subscriptions only allow 1 Starlink Terminal per Service Line. Some subscriptions, for example "Priority Mobile - 5TB", allow 2 Starlink Terminals per Service Line.
