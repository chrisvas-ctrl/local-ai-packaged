### What is a Starlink identifier?
After purchasing Starlink from an authorized retailer or via transfer, your unique Starlink identifier will be needed to activate your service. You can locate the Starlink identifier through the Starlink app (Terminal ID) and/or by the Kit Serial Number (either on the shipping label or hardware). Please see details on where to find the Starlink identifiers below. 
Note, this step is not needed if you purchased from Starlink.com.
**Starlink identifier formats:**
  * Terminal ID (located in the Starlink app)
    1. If you recently downloaded the app, click "Connect to Wifi" and choose the STARLINK network.
    2. In the Starlink app home screen, scroll down to the bottom of the page and select "Advanced".
    3. Under the 'Starlink' section, locate your Starlink identifier/Terminal ID (ex. 01000000-00000000-00e1c9f7 - do not include "ut" in front).
