### I am outside of the 30 day return window, can I return for a partial refund?
Unfortunately for all mounts and accessories if you are outside the 30 day return window you will not be eligible for any refund. 
For your kit you may still qualify for a partial refund (subject to eligibility). To see your estimated refund amount follow the steps to cancel service. Before confirming, you will see your estimated refund amount.
