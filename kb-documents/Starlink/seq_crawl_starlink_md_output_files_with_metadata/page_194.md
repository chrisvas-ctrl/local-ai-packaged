### What is the telemetry API and how do I get started?
The Starlink Telemetry API is a low-latency API for accessing the telemetry data from Starlink devices. It will provide similar data to what you see in the Dashboard > Manage > "Network Statistics" section of your portal.
The Telemetry API is designed for users that have their own data infrastructure to monitor Starlink devices remotely.This feature enables the ability to perform analysis in near real-time to characterize Starlink device performance relative to ongoing operations.
To get started, please review the "Getting Started" and "Authentication" Guides on our [readme.io](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/readme.com/>) documentation (<https://starlink.readme.io/docs>). Your account manager can provide a password for access.
