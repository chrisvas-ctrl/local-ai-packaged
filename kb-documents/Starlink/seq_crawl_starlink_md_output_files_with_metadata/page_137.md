### I need to ship my kit to another location, does Starlink sell shipping boxes and materials?
At this time, we do not sell shipping boxes or materials. If you do not have the original Starlink packaging, you can use alternate packaging materials to safely secure your Starlink during transit. Please remember to stow your Starlink prior to packaging.
