### Additional Starlink Kit Purchase - Service Charge
When ordering an additional Starlink Kit through your account, a pro-rated monthly service cost will appear on the billing cycle after shipment. 
The pro-rated cost is calculated starting 14 days after the Starlink has shipped, and is based on the cost of the service plan chosen and the time remaining in the service period.
