### How do I set up and authenticate API?
API access is available for Starlink Authorized Resellers or Enterprise Customers in order to manage accounts, user terminals, and service.
To set up API access, log into your Starlink account and select the "Settings" tab. In the section named "Service Accounts" select the "Add Service Account" in the top right corner to create a new service account.
If you do not see the section "Service Accounts" please contact Customer Support for assistance.
For detailed authentication questions, refer to the "Authentication" guide on our [readme.io](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/readme.com/>) documentation (<https://starlink.readme.io/docs>). Your account manager can provide a password for access to our documentation.
