### How does Starlink handle snow and ice?
Your Starlink has Snow Melt functionality, which allows it to automatically use the power it draws to heat itself to melt the snow off. This feature helps to prevent impacts on service, while also preventing the need for you to get on the roof to remove the snow from your Starlink.
Icicles themselves should also not impact performance. If you prefer, you can gently remove ice at any time. Most of the time, ice will not impact service, but could prevent the motors from moving if Starlink needs to be repositioned. We recommend against using tools (picks, chisels) to prevent damaging your Starlink.
If the base of your Starlink is impeded by snow build up or ice, you may get an alert through the Starlink App that motors are blocked. If you get this alert, you may need to gently remove the ice/icicles to allow Starlink to reposition, but this should rarely happen.
Heavy snow accumulation on the top of your Starlink could have impacts on your service. If your Starlink is completely covered with heavy snow, this would most likely result in an intermittent connection or in no service at all. We recommend that you install your Starlink in a location that will not be buried in the snow, or on areas of your home where snow is not known to build up.
