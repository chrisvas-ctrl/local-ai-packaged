### How does the monthly service billing cycle work?
The "Monthly Service Billing Cycle" refers to a 1-month service period for which you will be billed. You can view your billing cycle and payment due date in the [billing tab](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/billing>) of your Starlink account.
Your billing cycle is based on the day your Starlink kit is first activated. Upon activation, your first statement (invoice) will appear in your account and the payment method on file will be automatically charged. If your Starlink is not activated within 30 days post-shipment, it will be automatically activated.
For example, if you first activate on June 28th, your billing cycle will be June 28th - July 27th. This means you will receive service from June 28th - July 27th. You will be billed on June 28th and your payment will be due the same day, on June 28th. Your next billing cycle would be July 28th - August 27th. You would be billed and your payment would be due on July 28th. Please note that billing cycles vary per user and your dates may be different from those in the example.
**When is payment due for my monthly subscription?**
Your automatic payment date is the first day of your billing cycle. Subscription payments will be automatically charged to the payment method on file on your Payment Due Date. For Mobile Money payments, you will need to log into your account each month on the Payment Due Date to complete your payment. Please note that billing date changes or delays are not supported.
**Am I able to preview my upcoming charges?**
You are able to preview your next monthly service invoice from your account at any time by clicking "Preview Next Invoice". The invoice preview will update each day of the month and will reflect all charges due as of that day, including any applicable overage data usage from your current cycle or recent changes to your service plan.
​ 
**Note for Brazil:** The first invoice has a net 7 payment term, meaning it is due 7 calendar days from the invoice date. This applies to the first invoice only.
