### When can I expect my order to ship?
Your order will ship within the estimated shipping timeline provided on your order details page found on your [Account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>) page, or from the Starlink App. We will notify you if the estimated shipping timeline changes.
Your order details show you the status of your order. Statuses listed in chronological order:
  1. Pending - with the estimated delivery date
  2. Preparing Shipment - with the estimated delivery date
  3. Shipped - with the tracking number link ([FedEx](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.fedex.com/fedextrack/>)/[DHL](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/mydhl.express.dhl/us/en/home.html#/createNewShipmentTab>))


Once your order has been shipped, please [contact the carrier](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=c954e904-6c7b-0171-e845-567390f8bfb1>) shown on your tracking information for updates on your order. If youâ€™ve received a notice that your billing cycle will begin soon and your Starlink Kit has been in transit for the past 30 days, rest assured that your 30-day trial period will be extended by an additional 30 days, and a one-month service credit will be applied to your account. 
Note: Certain countries (e.g. Brazil, Philippines) may experience longer delivery timelines.
