### What is a Roam activation charge?
In applicable markets, the Standard Starlink Kit has an associated one-time charge to enable portable capabilities for our Mobile service plans. This charge is fully refundable if you return Starlink within 30 days of purchase. The Roam Activation is only applicable to a specific customers account and is not transferable.
