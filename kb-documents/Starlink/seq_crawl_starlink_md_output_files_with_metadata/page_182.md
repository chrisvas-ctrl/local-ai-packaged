### I have tried the Starlink Mini in my aircraft, and it did not work for me. What are my options? 
We recommend waiting for your aircraft to be eligible for our Starlink Aeroterminal solution, that requires a Supplemental Type Certificates (“STC”). Starlink is actively working at obtaining STCs for all major airframes.
