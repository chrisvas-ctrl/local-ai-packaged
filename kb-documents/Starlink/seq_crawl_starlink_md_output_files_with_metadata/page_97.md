If you are encountering errors when updating your payment method, please: 
  1. Double check the the payment information entered is correct. 
  2. Confirm with your financial institution the payment method is not actively being blocked.
  3. Confirm that your [payment method is supported](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/aa96adbe-6b47-4d59-d76f-65f140525c5d>).

If you still encounter errors, we recommend using a Desktop/Laptop and not attempting on a phone. The following steps may also help:
