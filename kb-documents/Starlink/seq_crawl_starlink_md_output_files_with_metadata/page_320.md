### I live in an area with snow, heavy rain, wind, lightning, or extreme temperatures - can I still use Starlink?
Starlink is designed and tested to handle a wide range of temperatures and weather conditions including snow, hail, sleet, heavy rain, and extreme heat. Starlink is not designed to handle hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, meteors, dinosaurs, or other extreme forces of nature.
  * **Temperature** - Starlink is rated to operate outdoors between -30 to +50 degrees Celsius, or -22 to +122 degrees Fahrenheit, and the router and power supply are also rated to operate indoors between 0 to +30 degrees Celsius, or +32 to +86 degrees Fahrenheit. During moments of extreme heat or cold, Starlink may experience slightly reduced performance.
  * **Snow** - Starlink also has the ability to melt snow! This feature helps prevent service degradation during wintry conditions. We recommend installing Starlink in a location that avoids snow build-up and other obstructions from blocking the field of view.
  * **Rain** - Starlink is designed to operate in wet conditions; it's hydrophobic and has a low affinity to water. In extreme cases, heavy rain or wind may affect your connection, potentially leading to slower speeds or a rare outage. It is strongly recommended that you do not apply additional protective covers as this will degrade Starlinkâ€™s performance including its ability to melt snow.
  * **Lightning** - Starlink meets the U.S. National Electrical Code (NEC) grounding requirements. However, if you live in an area with lightning, an external lightning protection system (lightning rod, ground rod, surge protector, etc.) may reduce susceptibility to lightning. For added protection during a lightning storm, or when it is left unattended and unused for long periods of time, unplug the product from the wall AC outlet and disconnect the Starlink cable. This may prevent damage to the product from lightning and power line surges.


For users or businesses who require higher performance while living in the most extreme weather conditions, we recommend High Performance Starlink. The larger, High Performance Starlink comes with better snow melt capabilities as well as the ability to have faster speeds in high temperature environments.

**Note:** High Performance Starlink is not currently available in the US and CA, we recommend Flat High Performance Starlink.
