### How do I assign roles to users on my account?
Log in to your Starlink [account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>) in order to assign a user (contact) a specific role on your account:
  1. From your account home page, navigate to the "Settings" page
  2. In the users section, select "Edit" from the menu to the right of the existing user you wish to edit the role for
     * If you do not see the users table, you may not have a role that allows you to see or edit users. Reach out to an admin on your account to update your role if necessary.
  3. Navigate to the "Roles" field and select the role(s) you wish to assign for this user
  4. Click "Save" to save/update the roles for this user


Limitation: Maximum number of users per account, including account owner's contact information:
  * Residential accounts: 3
  * Business accounts: 500
  * Enterprise (managed business) accounts: 1500


Once you have reached the maximum number of users for your account, you will see a message stating "You have reached the max allowed users on your account".
