### Monthly Overage Data Charges (Opt-In/Out)
While monthly service is charged at the start of the billing cycle, opt-in overage data is charged at the end of the billing cycle.
If you surpassed your included monthly Priority or Mobile Priority Data AND you opted in to additional data at any point within the billing cycle, the overage data consumed while opted-in will be totaled at the end of the service period and charged on your next bill.
