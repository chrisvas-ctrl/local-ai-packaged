​
**Notes:**

​
**The light on your router is the status:**
  * **Solid White** : Power connected
  * **No Light:** No power connected


​
**Getting Connected**
  1. Connect to the STARLINK network from your device WiFi settings.
     * 'STARLINK' is the router's default WiFi network name (SSID).
  2. To secure your Starlink WiFi network, use the Starlink App to rename your Starlink WiFi network and create a WiFi password. Open the Starlink App > Settings > Router > enter desired WiFi network name and password > Save.
     * This step is optional, however we recommend securing your WiFi network. Your Starlink WiFi network is not password protected until you set the password.
