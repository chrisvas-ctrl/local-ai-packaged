### Locked out of account
**Never Received Email to Set Up My Account**
If you did not receive a confirmation email after placing your initial order or cannot find any emails from Starlink, you may have entered your email address incorrectly at sign up. Try [account recovery](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.com/auth/forgot-password>) "by phone" to reset your password. You will be logged into your account, where you can then update any account information like your email address.
​
**Locked Out / Forgot Password**
  1. Navigate to <https://www.starlink.com/auth/forgot-password>
  2. Under Forgot Password, enter the email or phone number that is associated with your account
  3. Click on "Request Password Reset"
  4. Check spam folder for email and ensure there is enough space in your inbox.
     * If you still do not see the email/text message, try using a different device.
  5. If unsuccessful for both email and phone number recovery, **contact support another way[here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/guest-contact?source=locked_out_faq>)**.
