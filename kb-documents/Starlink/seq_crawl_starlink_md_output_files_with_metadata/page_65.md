### Starlink Kit Deposit Charge
If ordering in a location that is at capacity, you can make a deposit. Upon completing your order, you will be charged a one-time deposit cost. This cost is later subtracted from the total due for the Starlink hardware cost. 
The deposit cost is only applied to the total Starlink hardware cost. It is not applied to the first month service cost.
