### Why do I need a service address for a mobile plan? 
A service address is required on your account, regardless of mobility status, for taxing and invoicing requirements. The service address listed on the account will not affect where the Starlink can be used. In order to ensure there are no disruptions to service or billing, your service address must be located within the country on the account. 
If you are a business account and need help determining the country listed on your account, please reach out to customer support.
