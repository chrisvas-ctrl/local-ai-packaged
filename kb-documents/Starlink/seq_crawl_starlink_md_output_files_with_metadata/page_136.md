### Can I change my order's shipping address to a different country?
You cannot change your order's shipping address to a different country. You can change the shipping address to a different location if within the same country as original sign up, at any time.
To permanently transfer a Starlink account to a different country, see the transfer requirements [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=f3cad923-ed28-f957-365c-787f8fe2e4a2>).
