### What is a demand charge?
In areas with high demand, there is an additional one-time charge to purchase Starlink services. The additional charge depends on the location of your Service address, the Service Plan you choose, and/or the Starlink Kit you select. This charge will only apply if you are purchasing or activating a new service plan. If you change your Service address or Service Plan at a later date, you may be charged the demand charge. If you're not satisfied with Starlink and return it within the 30-day return window, the charge will be refunded.
