### Does Starlink offer DC-input power supply options?
_The Standard DC-DC Power Supply is currently only available in the US._
We are pleased to offer the Standard DC-DC Power Supply, compatible with Starlink Standard. The Standard DC-DC Power Supply is designed to power your Starlink Standard directly from a DC power source, removing the need for an inverter when powered from your RV, car, boat or battery pack. It features an XT60 connector on both sides and uses a 12AWG wire. 
For more details, please check out our DC Power Supply [specification sheet](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/public-files/specification_sheet_standard_dc_dc_power_supply.pdf>).
