**Hardware and Warranty:** Flat High Performance, Standard, and Mini are the approved Starlinks for in-motion use. Customers using an actuated Starlink that contains motors (ex. Standard Actuated Starlink, High Performance Starlink) while in motion do so at their own risk as they are not designed for in-motion use; equipment falling onto the road or off a vessel due to poor installation practices can cause serious accidents resulting in bodily injury or damage to property. Damage to the Starlink while in motion may result in a void of your Starlink warranty. **For customers in Japan & Mexico, in-motion use of Starlink on land is prohibited due to local regulations.**
