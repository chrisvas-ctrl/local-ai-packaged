### How to fix obstructions
The simplest way to fix your obstruction-related interruptions is to use the "Check for Obstructions" tool in the Starlink app to find a location on your property that does not contain obstructions, and relocate your Starlink. When relocating your Starlink, unplug and reboot.
Other ways to deal with an existing obstruction:
  * You can clear the obstruction fully (such as branch removal)
  * You can raise your Starlink above the obstruction by using our Starlink mount options (e.g. extended cables) available in the [Starlink shop](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.com/shop/>) or using third-party installation options such as towers, poles, etc.


If you cannot safely install the Starlink kit or clear obstructions, do not proceed and seek professional assistance. See [Terms of Service](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal/documents/DOC-1020-91087-64?regionCode=US>) for more details.
​
**What if I suddenly get an obstruction alert, after being set up for a long time without any alerts?**
This alert banner may disappear as Starlink gets better at avoiding obstructions as it learns more about surrounding obstructions. Common new obstructions include:
  * New branches or leaves, especially in the spring when trees are regaining leaves and are more likely to block your Starlink's field of view.
  * Material buildup on the Starlink - ensure that nothing has fallen or coated your Starlink, such as dead leaves or soil.
  * Snow on the Starlink - while your Starlink will automatically melt off general snow, a blizzard can leave temporary snow buildup.


​
**What if the app says "Obstructed" and I get frequent interruptions?**
The Starlink app will show this alert when obstructions have had a significant impact on performance recently. This may be more common shortly after clearing the obstruction map, while Starlink is still learning about nearby obstructions. This could also mean the Starlink has material build-up or has fallen over, but is less common.
If you are experiencing performance issues when engaging in high usage internet applications such as gaming, you may need to take action to adjust your Starlink or it's surrounding obstructions.
