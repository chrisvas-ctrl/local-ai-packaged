###  How does ocean service vary from land service? 
Maritime service is very similar to land service. However, there are extra systems to ensure satellites know to communicate with a vessel as it moves into new patches of the ocean.
Additionally, if a vessel strays into the waters of a country which prohibits Starlink from operating within it, our satellites will be unable to communicate with it effectively.
