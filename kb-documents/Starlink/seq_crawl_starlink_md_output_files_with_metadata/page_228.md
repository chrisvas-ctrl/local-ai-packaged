### How do I set up a child account? 
Child accounts assist larger business customers in organizing their Starlinks. Starlinks can be organized to simplify invoicing for the various ways a business may be utilizing Starlink. 
Example: A transportation company may want child accounts to delineate their Starlinks on busses, airplanes and trains. 
To set up a child account, contact your Account Manager.
