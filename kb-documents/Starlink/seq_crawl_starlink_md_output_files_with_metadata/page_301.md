### My IP geolocation is incorrect or too far away.
The Starlink team is working to provide closer internet geolocation so that you receive internet (search results, television shows, access to content) that is closer to your actual location. Currently our internet geolocation may be further than your actual location (several states, provinces, or sub-regions). Starlink today will assign an IP address to the same country of your service address however providing an IP address in your specific location is not guaranteed at this time.
