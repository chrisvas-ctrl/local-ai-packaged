### I can't get online through the ethernet port
If you're using the Starlink router and equipment and you cannot get internet to your device over ethernet, but you can get internet via WiFi, it could be an issue with either your personal equipment or the Starlink equipment. 
Please try the following:
  1. Try using multiple ethernet cables.
     * If you can connect with a different cable, then the issue is with the original ethernet cable.
  2. Try connecting different devices to the router with the working ethernet cable.
     * If you're only experiencing connection issues on one device, then the issue is rooted to the ethernet port on that device. We recommend reaching out to that device's manufacturer.
  3. If all devices cannot get internet, then it is likely an issue with your Starlink ethernet adapter or your Starlink router.


If you suspect this issue to be caused by any Starlink hardware based on these steps, please click "Contact Support" to submit a support ticket with the following information:
  * Photos of the equipment (ethernet adapter, ports, connectors, and any damage)
  * Any troubleshooting steps you've already taken
