### What is the alignment tool and how do I use it?
_The alignment tool is only relevant for users of the: Starlink Standard Kit, Starlink Enterprise Kit, and Starlink Mini Kit._
When setting up your Starlink Standard or Starlink Mini, you will need to be sure your Starlink is properly aligned. This means that your Starlink needs to point towards the part of the sky where it spends the most time communicating with satellites overhead. Click [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/videos/9>) to view a video on how to align your Starlink.
Once your Starlink is online, tap "Alignment" in the Starlink app and follow the prompts on screen to align your Starlink. 
**Starlink Standard & Starlink Enterprise:**

If your Starlink needs to be realigned, the Starlink App will alert you with "Starlink Misaligned", indicating that your Starlink is misaligned by at least 5°. From there, readjust the position of your Starlink until it matches the directions displayed on the app.
  * _Note: The Starlink app will not alert you if your Starlink is less than 5° misaligned. You can always find the Alignment Tool from the Home Screen at the bottom of the page._
