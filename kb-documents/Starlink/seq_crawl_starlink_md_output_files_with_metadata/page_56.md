### Can Starlink manually run my credit card for a specific amount, on a specific day, without going through the account portal? 
All charges for service, hardware and accessories can only be processed through the account portal or the Starlink shop. Automatic credit card payments cannot be for a partial amount or on a set date. The credit card saved on the account will be billed for total charges on the payment due date.
