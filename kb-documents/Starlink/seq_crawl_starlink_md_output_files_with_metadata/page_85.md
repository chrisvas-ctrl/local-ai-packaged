### How do I request an electronic invoice (E-invoice) from Starlink Guatemala?
You can request your e-invoice or electronic invoice to include the tax information reflected in your Tax ID Certificate NIT (e.g., Legal Name, Tax ID, Zip Code, Tax Regime) for physical orders and subscription services you have purchased from Starlink.
For this, you need to send your NIT information to Starlink by using the following information below.
**Important:** You must follow the steps below within 60 calendar days from the date of your most recent Starlink Kit order. If you do not send your NIT/tax information to Starlink within such 60 calendar days, your E-invoices or electronic invoices will only be issued with the updated information going forward (no past invoices will be corrected).
**How do I submit my NIT information?**
**Important:** Your legal name and NIT stated in your support ticket or reflected in your Tax ID Certificate (NIT) must match the full name or legal entity entered on your Starlink account.
To send your tax information, please submit a support ticket and attach your tax identification (NIT) in PDF format that includes the Name, Postal Code, only in case there is any particular preference.
**How will I receive my E-invoice?**
Your e-invoice or electronic invoice (both PDF and XML files) will be sent automatically to the email registered on your Starlink account, directly from avdmail@avdinternacional.com. We cannot send e-invoices to multiple emails at this time.
**Note:** You can only request invoices within 60 calendar days from the date of your most recent Starlink Kit order within the fiscal year. Starlink will not correct E-invoices from previous years.
**Important:** Per our Terms of Service: Supplemental customer support for business or government specific requests (e.g., modified invoicing or tax-exempt certifications) are only available under Starlinkâ€™s Priority Service Plans and may not be supported under Residential Service Plan subscriptions.
**What do I do if I need to change my tax information again after I submit my initial information?**
If your tax information (NIT) is updated (i.e., you moved and your postal code on NIT changed), then we can update your tax information. Please follow steps above to submit a support ticket and mention that the information on your NIT has been updated and provide the documentation with this change (if applicable).
