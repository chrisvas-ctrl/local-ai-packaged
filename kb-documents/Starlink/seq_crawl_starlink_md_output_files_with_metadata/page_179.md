### Is there an optimal location to place Starlink Mini in an aircraft for best connectivity?
A flat placement with the clearest possible view of the sky is recommended. A vertical placement against a cabin window will usually lead to poor connectivity. 
You may experience degraded performance when placing the terminal on the cockpit dashboard or under your aircraft’s canopy or ceiling window (if available) due to the aircraft’s window material, deicing technology and angle of the glass, among other factors. 
To optimize your connection, orient the terminal facing north when flying in the northern hemisphere. Conversely, orient the terminal facing south in the southern hemisphere. 
As you find the optimal location for your Starlink Mini, always ensure that the terminal is positioned in a location that the aircraft operator has deemed is safe for the crew and passengers and does not in any way, impede visibility, other aircraft systems or the safe operation of the aircraft.
