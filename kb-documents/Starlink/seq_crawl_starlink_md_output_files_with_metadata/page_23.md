### How do I change my billing or payment method?
To update your credit card / payment method:
  1. Log into your Starlink [account page](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>)
  2. Select the "Billing" tab.


You can then enter new card or payment information under "Automatic Payment Method". 
Available payment methods vary by country of service. Available methods will automatically appear when you place an order or edit the payment method via your account.
Make sure that you enter your name and information exactly as it appears on your payment method.
