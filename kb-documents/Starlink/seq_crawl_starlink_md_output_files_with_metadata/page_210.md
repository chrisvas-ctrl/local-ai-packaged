### Do I need a certificate of origin?
A Certificate of Origin is not required for import in a majority of cases as the provided invoice meets most import requirements. Managed accounts can be issued a Certificate of Origin on a case by case basis. If you require a Certificate of Origin, please reach out to your Account Manager.
