#### Why was I automatically charged for service?
When you buy Starlink from starlink.com, you are charged for the Starlink kit, but not your first month's service.
Your first bill will occur either on activation or 30 days after your Starlink ships, whichever comes first.
#### When will I receive my referral credit?
Referral credits are automatically applied 30-days after the referee activates their account. The credit will be automatically used to deduct from your next invoice.
Please note, in order to receive a referral credit, the referral link must have been used. We are unable to issue referral credits in cases where the referral link was not used. 
For more information on the referrals, see [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/1361c631-2c31-271a-732b-bab080fb1384>). 
#### Can I receive a refund if the current price of a Starlink kit is less than when I purchased mine?
If you ordered within the past 30 days, please reach out to Starlink Customer Support by submitting a support ticket for further assistance. 
#### I wasn't using service, can I have a refund?
We are unable to issue refunds or credits for unused service. Your Starlink subscription service is a month to month service which is not contingent on usage.
Much like other monthly subscriptions or a cell phone carrier, services are still being provided regardless of the amount data used as we're maintaining your dish's spot within our network.
#### Can I make a partial payment for my bill?
We understand that flexibility in payments can be helpful, but unfortunately, our system requires that the full balance be paid in a single transaction. At this time, we are unable to:
  * Offer payment plans
  * Split payments between multiple payment methods
  * Pay off past balances separately
  * Adjust or delay billing due dates


We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.
#### Can I make I make a late payment for my bill?
Starlink is unable to accommodate requests to defer or adjust payment dates. Please note, you can make a payment at any time by navigating to the Billing tab and selecting the 'Make a Payment' button.
#### When will I be charged if I switch my service plan?
If you are upgrading to a more expensive service plan, you will be charged at the time you upgrade. The charge be the pro-rated amount of the new service plan for the remainder of your current monthly service period. 
If you are downgrading to a less expensive plan, the downgrade will take affect at the end of your current monthly service period. You will then be charged for the new service plan on the subsequent month's bill. 
#### How do I update my billing address?
You can update your billing address by updating your automatic payment method. 
Go to Account -> Billing -> Then click on the pencil next to Automatic Payment Method.
#### How much is my monthly subscription?
Your monthly subscription price varies depending on your service plan. You can view previous months' charges in the billing tab of your Starlink account. For specific details you can download invoices for review. You can preview your upcoming bill by clicking "Preview Next Invoice". The invoice preview will update each day of the month and will reflect all charges due as of that day, including any applicable overage data usage from your current cycle or recent changes to your service plan.
#### How can I change my tax id from my personal tax number to my business tax number.
Residential/Standard accounts are for personal use only and not for commercial/business uses. We are unable to add business tax information to a residential account. 
If you would like to use your business/legal entity you must create a new business account to obtain the desired plan and billing options.
