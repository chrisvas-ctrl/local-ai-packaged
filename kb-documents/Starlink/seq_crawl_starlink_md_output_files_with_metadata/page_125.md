### How do I return my mount or accessory?
You can return a purchased mount/accessory from the Starlink Shop within 30 days of delivery to receive a full refund. If you are outside the 30 day window, you are unable to return your order. The self service return flow is only available on desktop, and returning through the app will require a ticket to be submitted. 
Here are the steps to initiate a return:
  1. Navigate to the "[Your Orders](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>)" tab, then select the affected order.
  2. Click "Return" under the Order Details section and follow the steps to initiate your return. 
  3. If the "Return" button is not shown click "Contact Support" at the bottom of this topic within 30 days of receiving your order.
  4. Select the the order number and include the item name in your message to reach Support for further assistance.
