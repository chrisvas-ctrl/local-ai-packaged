### How do I clean my Starlink?
The radome surface uses pure Teflon, allowing us to have an extremely slippery and hydrophobic surface. You may use a microfiber cloth and glass cleaner, like Windex, to gently clean your Starlink.
Please do not spray any paint on the radome surface or cover the unit with a cloth or other material. This will impede the Starlink's ability to shed snow and rain, resulting in severely degraded performance in severe weather conditions. 
  * Off the shelf hydrophobic treatments recommended on the internet for other company's satellite dishes such as NeverWet and RainX are not recommended.
