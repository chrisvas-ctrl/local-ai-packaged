### Billing - Credits
Credits can have 3 types: generic, service, or hardware.
Credits are automatically applied to the next bill that appears in your account. For example, if your account had a pending bill at the time the service credit was added, then the service credit will not change the scheduled payment amount, and instead will be applied to your following bill.
If you believe a credit should have been included in your most recent bill, or the credit amount is incorrect, please create a support ticket and provide details about the issue. For Enterprise and Premium Business customers, if you believe a credit should apply to an existing invoice, please create a support ticket with the credit number and invoice number.
Credits can be viewed in your account by going to [starlink.com/account/billing](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/billing>). The credit table is below the invoice table and will show the available balance and the total amount of the credit. There is also a summary of available credits below the account balance box in the upper left corner of the page.
