Many questions are answered within our support topics, but if you cannot find the information you are looking for, or are still experiencing issues, the Starlink support team is staffed 24/7 in multiple languages to help. 
Customers can contact support by creating a support ticket describing your issue. Our support team will reply either via message or by calling the phone number on your account as soon as possible.
Starlink registered offices listed online and on invoices are not staffed by customer support representatives and do not handle customer support inquiries, including deliveries or returns. Any customer support inquiries should be directed through Starlink.com or the Starlink app as described above.
All orders placed on Starlink.com are shipped directly to the customer. No intermediaries besides local logistics partners (DHL Express, Post Office, etc) will serve as pickup locations.
​
#### How to Create a Support Ticket:
  * From the Starlink App: The app is the preferred method to contact support, as it sends along diagnostic information from your Starlink that enables faster resolution. Sign in to your account, click support option on the main screen, and then click the contact support button.
  * From your Starlink.com account: [Sign in](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.com/auth/>) to your Starlink account, navigate to the [support](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/>) tab, and then click [contact support](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/create-support-ticket?source=customer_support_channels_faq>).


If needed, the customer support chatbot can help you create support ticket. You also can create one directly by clicking "Do you need help from a human? Create a ticket" at the bottom of the customer support chatbot screen.
