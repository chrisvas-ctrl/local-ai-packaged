Yes. The Gen 3 router has two LAN Ethernet ports. They are located under the rubber cover on the back of your router and labeled with the LAN Icon. They may be used to connect wired mesh or other devices such as TVs, computers, smart devices, etc. If you need more, you can buy an Ethernet switch to create additional ports.

#### Gen 2 Router

No. The Gen 2 router included with the Starlink Standard Actuated or High Performance Starlink Kits does not come with built-in Ethernet ports. However, there is an Ethernet adapter available for purchase on the [Starlink Shop](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/starlink.com/shop>) to allow for a wired connection to the network. If you need more than one port, a network switch can be connected to the ethernet adapter. Alternatively, the High Performance Kits have an external power supply and an included RJ45 cable for direct hardwired connections that bypass the Starlink router and can be used to connect alternative routers for wired network set-ups.

#### Gen 1 Router

Yes. The Gen 1 router included with the Standard (Circular) Starlink has one Ethernet port. It is labeled as AUX and may be used to connect wired devices (TVs, computers, smart devices, etc.). If you need more than one port, a network switch can be connected to the ethernet adapter.
