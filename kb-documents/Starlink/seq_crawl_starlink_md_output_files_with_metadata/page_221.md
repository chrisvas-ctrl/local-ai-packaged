### When can I receive a packing list with the serial numbers for my Starlinks? 
Packing lists containing Starlink kit serial numbers will be available once an order has been packed and is ready for shipment. Orders will be packed once your payment has been fully received for the order. Packing lists will be provided via email with your shipment tracking information.
To inquire about a missing packing list, please reach out to customer support.
