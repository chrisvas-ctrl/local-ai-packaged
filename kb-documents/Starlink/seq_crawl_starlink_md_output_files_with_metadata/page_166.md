#### Local Priority Plan:
Priority, high-speed service for businesses and other high-demand users for in-motion use within one country. All plans include priority support, public IP, and a telemetry dashboard. After using the set amount of Priority Data (e.g. 1TB), continue receiving unlimited data that operates with speeds of up to 1 Mbps download and up to 0.5 Mbps upload.
Local Priority Service plans are intended for inland coverage (including lakes and rivers) only; not for global or ocean use (Coastal coverage & use in territorial waters is not permitted). Services may be used (i) locally in-country, or (ii) for up to 60 consecutive days within your region in a location outside the country of your Service address. For a map showing countries by region, please visit [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/public-files/Global_Arbitrage_Policy_Enforcement.png>). (1: US/Canada ; 2: Latin America ; 3: Europe ; 4: Africa ; 5: Asia ; 6: Oceania). In-motion use up to 350 mph. Prices for Data Blocks purchased under the Local Priority Plan will vary based on location. For Local Priority plans, customers will only be allowed to have 1 Starlink terminal per service line.
​
#### Global Priority Plan:
Priority, high-speed service for businesses and other high-demand users for in-motion use anywhere where Starlink is available. All plans include priority support, public IP, and a telemetry dashboard. After using the set amount of Global Priority Data (e.g. 1 TB), continue receiving unlimited data that operates with speeds of up to 1 Mbps download and up to 0.5 Mbps upload.
Global Priority service plans are intended for global and ocean coverage. In-motion use up to 550 mph. Prices for Data Blocks purchased under the Global Priority Plan will not vary and will be consistent around the world. For Global Priority plans, customers may assign up to 2 Starlink terminals per service line; provided, however, that such terminals must be used on the same vehicle, vessel, or building.
​
Priority plans give you the flexibility to match your data needs. Choose from one of our preset plans, and adjust it to your needs by adding blocks of data in increments of 50GB or 500GB.

#### Priority Service Plans FAQs:
​
**Will the prices of the new plans vary globally?**
Yes, Local Priority plans will vary by country. Global Priority plans will have a consistent price globally.
​
**Will my current plan be grand-fathered in?**
No, all Priority and Mobile Priority plans will be transitioned to the new structure using the same data level, starting April 2025 (existing Starlink customers on these plans will receive an email with information related to the transition). For example, existing 1TB plans will be transitioned to the new structure with 1TB of data. Customers can optimize the amount of data on their service lines after the transition if needed.

​
**Can I buy Roam Unlimited instead of Local and Global Priority plans?**
No, business and enterprise customers are limited to Priority service plans. Residential and Roam service products are designed for consumers.
​
**I have a Business/Enterprise account with the Priority plans, but want to switch to a Residential/Roam service plan. What should I do?**
Changing to a Residential/Roam service plan here will require you to complete a transfer of service to a Residential account. In order to complete a transfer of service, please follow the steps listed in [this FAQ](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/nz/support/article/f3cad923-ed28-f957-365c-787f8fe2e4a2>). (Note: Transfers are not allowed until 120 days after purchase or 90 days after activation—whichever comes first.)
​
**Can I set up a service line with just the terminal access fee if I don't expect much data usage?**
No, every service line must have recurring data included with the service line.
​
**Do service lines default to opted-in for additional Priority data when recurring Priority data is exhausted?**
No, the default setting is to be opted-out (except for Enterprise customers).
​
**How does opting-in to additional Priority Data work?**
You can opt-in for automatic top-ups. For example, if you have 500GB of recurring data and you are opted-in for additional Priority data, when you exceed 500GB a 50GB block will automatically be added to your service line.
You can also purchase individual top-up blocks in increments of 50GB. If you have 500GB of recurring data and exhaust your data, you can then buy an additional 50GB block of Priority Data to use for the remainder of your billing period. 
​
**Do the automatic top-up blocks recur each month?**
No, the 50GB top-up blocks that are automatically added when your Priority data is exhausted do not recur. Only monthly recurring blocks are recurring. 
​
**Do top-up blocks roll-over?**
No.
​
**Can I opt-out of additional Priority data?**
Yes, If you opt-out of additional Priority data, the service will be limited to 1Mbps download and 0.5Mbps upload after your recurring Priority data is consumed. You can choose to opt-in or opt-out at any time. 
​
**Can multiple terminals be on the same service line?**
Service Lines with the Local Priority Service Plan will only be allowed 1 Starlink terminal. Service Lines with the Global Priority Service Plan will be allowed up to 2 Starlink terminals on the same service line if they are on the same vessel, vehicle, or building. Only one terminal access charge will be needed for Service Lines with 2 Starlink terminals. Limits may apply.
​
**Will Local Priority plans be able to operate in territorial waters?**
No, a Global Priority plan will be required to operate in territorial waters.
​
**What is the maximum speed the Priority plans will operate at?**
  * Local Priority: 350 mph
  * Global Priority: 550 mph


​
**If I use the APIs, when will I have details on API changes?**
Starlink is working to have a summary of API changes on the API Readme at least 30 days prior to changes taking place.
