### How do I update my Starlink if it doesn't automatically update?
_Important Note - Make sure your Starlink App software is on the latest version before proceeding._
If your Starlink is online, Starlink will automatically download any firmware updates and install them overnight. If you are on the Starlink App while Starlink is updating, you will see an indicator below the status title on the status screen, otherwise you will not be alerted of the update.
If your Starlink user terminal has been disconnected or offline for more than a few months, a manual software update may be required to get back online. Follow the steps in the app to update your Starlink software.
