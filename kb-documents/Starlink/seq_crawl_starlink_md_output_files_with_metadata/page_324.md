### My hardware is damaged
Your Starlink Kit uses packaging that may shed during shipping, resulting in dust. We can assure you your hardware is not used if not explicitly stated. Please click [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=8fea9af7-0adf-9785-fa35-e51fc0b428a6>) for additional information. To determine if your hardware damage is covered under warranty, you can view your hardware's [Limited Warranty](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/legal/warranty>) coverage page.
**Warranty Replacement Claim**

**Replacement not covered under warranty:**
