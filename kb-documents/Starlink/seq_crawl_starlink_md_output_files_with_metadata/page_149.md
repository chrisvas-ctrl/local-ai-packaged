### What are the limitations of Global Priority service plans?
**Coastal Waters:** Starlink for maritime use should only be used in territorial waters where licensing is either held by SpaceX or the end user.
**FCC Authorization Notice:** Federal Communication Commission authorization to Starlink for in-motion services in the United States has been granted on a non-interference protected basis, i.e., unprotected basis with respect to operations in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. Therefore, Starlink’s in-motion operations, including for vessels, must accept any interference received from both current and future services authorized in the band – even if such interference causes undesirable operations for Starlink Services and its customers. Starlink in-motion Services must not cause harmful interference to any authorized service in the band, whether licensed or not.
