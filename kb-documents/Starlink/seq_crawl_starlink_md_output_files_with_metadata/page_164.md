#### How do I change from a business to residential service plan?
If you are using a Business service plan or are using a Business account and would like to change to Residential service plan, you will need to [transfer your device](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/f3cad923-ed28-f957-365c-787f8fe2e4a2>) and create a new Residential account by activating that device with a new account through <https://www.starlink.com/activate>. 
#### Can I have two Starlinks on the same subscription?
In most cases, one service line accommodates one subscription, one service address, and one terminal. This means most cusotmers cannot not have two Starlinks on the same subscription. Please note, you are still able to [add additional Starlinks to your account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/90bab5a0-7269-f17e-d9d2-81d70843141e>).
#### Why can I not cancel my order?
You can only cancel your order if your order has not been packed for shipment yet. If you are unable to cancel your order, you can attempt to contact the carrier listed in your tracking information after it ships. Otherwise you must wait and return the item after it has been delivered.
#### I purchased one Starlink but realized I wanted a different one instead, can I stop the first order and place a new one?
If your order has not been packed, you may be able to [cancel it](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/46fcbc54-5e06-eccb-4dcb-6bfee0e66d4e>). If you are unable to cancel it, you will have to wait for your order to be delivered, at which time you will be able to return it. You can place an order for your desired device in the meantime or wait until after your return has been processed if you so choose. 
#### I need to cancel my order.
You can only [cancel an order](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/46fcbc54-5e06-eccb-4dcb-6bfee0e66d4e>) if your order has not been packed for shipment yet. If you are unable to cancel your order, you can attempt to contact the carrier listed in your tracking information after it ships. Otherwise you must wait and return the item after it has been delivered.
#### How do I add an additional Starlink to my account?
If you have an additional Starlink you would like to add to an existing account, you activate the Starlink through <https://www.starlink.com/activate> and select "Existing Account".
#### I am unable to update my address.
If you are trying to update your service address and are unable to, it could be because that area is currently at capacity. You can verify if an area is at capacity by using the [map](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/map>). 
If your area is at capacity, you can place a deposit to reserve your spot on the waitlist and receive a notification as soon as service becomes available again. Please note that we cannot provide an estimated timeframe for service availability, but our teams are working diligently to expand coverage.
#### Why is my service restricted?
If you are using Roam 50GB, 20GB, or 5GB service plan and are not opted-in to additional data, your service will be restricted once you reach your data limit for your current service period. 
#### How do I secure my network?
You can [change your WiFi name and password](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/84fa18cf-758c-6fee-98e7-756d75d6f811>) through your Starlink account on the web or app. 
For security, after your password has been set, it will not be shown again. If you forget your WiFi password, factory reset your Starlink router to assign a new WiFi network name and password.
#### How do I reset my router without the app?
It is recommended that you follow the steps to reset your router through the app. But if you don't have the app or cannot connect to your router, you can follow the guide to reset your router [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/d68ed178-4d54-b486-b7d8-2a6273917632>).
#### What’s the difference between a service line number that starts with SL vs one that starts with AST?
There is no difference between service line numbers that start with "SL" and those that start with "AST." These are simply different naming conventions used for our service lines or subscriptions.
#### I placed an order before the "$0 Starlink Kit with 12-Month Commitment" was available, can I switch to it?
The "$0 Starlink Kit with 12-Month Commitment" option is only available to new customers in select locations at this time.
