### What kind of download speeds can I expect with Starlink Mini for Aviation? 
Starlink Mini can deliver up to 100Mbps download (and 10Mbps upload speed) in optimal circumstances. Note, the performance of both the antenna and router will depend on many factors, including (but not limited to) aircraft type, placement and angle of the antenna within the interior of the aircraft, cloud coverage, cabin size, obstruction levels including limited view of the sky or cockpit window de-icing technology, etc.
