### I live in an unincorporated area, how do I ensure my sales tax is correct?
If you live in an unincorporated area with unique sales tax, please ensure that your complete zip code with extra 4 digits is entered as your shipping address for hardware orders. This will ensure the accuracy of the sales tax charged on your order.
