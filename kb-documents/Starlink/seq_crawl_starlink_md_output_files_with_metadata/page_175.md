### Can Starlink Mini be used in an airplane?
For smaller General Aviation aircraft or for aircraft that we do not have an STC for yet, Starlink Mini may be used as a Portable Electronic Device (PED), on the interior of an aircraft only. 
For larger aircraft solutions and information related to our current and upcoming STCs, please see [here](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/support/article/9c43bea7-0645-5854-6842-dabb0def8a94>). 
Note, this use of Starlink Mini has not been certified or otherwise approved by the FAA or any other civil aviation authority. As you consider Starlink Mini, we encourage you to contact your local Flight Standard District Office (FSDO) in the US, and familiarize yourself with the[ FAA Advisory Circular 91.21-1D](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_91.21-1D.pdf>) “Use of Portable Electronic Devices Aboard Aircraft” to ensure that you meet all the operational requirements for use of Starlink Mini. 
Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the aircraft operator to determine the antenna position and installation that is optimal, safe, and does not interfere with the operation of the aircraft.
