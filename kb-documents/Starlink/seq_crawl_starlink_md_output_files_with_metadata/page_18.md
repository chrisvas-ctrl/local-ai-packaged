### Change shipping address for existing order
**Existing Order on Website:**

  5. Save change by selecting "Update Shipping Address"


The "pencil icon" will only be present while your order is in a "Pending" status. The shipping address cannot be changed after the order has been processed ("Preparing Shipment" or "Shipped"). Depending on your carrier and location you may have the option to make adjustments to your order post shipment. Please contact the carrier from your tracking link once the order has shipped. 
**Existing Order on App:**
  1. Login to the Starlink App
  2. Select the "Person" icon
  3. Select the "Orders" page
  4. Click the order you want to update the shipping address for
  5. Click the "Shipping to" box
  6. Once you click "Shipping to", enter the address details


_Note - If you receive an error when trying to update the address, check the "This address cannot be validated" box and try again._
  * **FedEx** : Any changes to the delivery location can be requested through [FedEx Delivery Manager](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.fedex.com/en-us/customer-support.html>) portal.
  * **DHL** : Please use DHL's On Demand Delivery Service provided by DHL. Click the hyperlink in the "Your shipment is on its way" notification for easy and efficient use. You can use DHL's [On Demand Delivery Site](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.ondemand.dhl.com/>) for any other change to a DHL shipment.


For Brazil – You have 3 hours from ordering your Starlink to change your shipping address. If within 3 hours, follow guidance below:
  * Changing shipping address within your same state: Navigate to your customer account, click “My Orders” and submit your shipping address change here.
  * Changing shipping address outside your current state: Cancel your order and place a reorder for your product using your new shipping address.


For future orders, you can either update your default shipping address in your account or you can enter a different shipping address at the time of shop checkout. 
If you see the option to "Cancel Order" under "Your Orders", that means you have the option to cancel the order before it is processed and can reorder it via the shop with the correct shipping address. If you do not see the option to cancel your order, that means your order has already been processed and cannot be cancelled or adjusted. **Note** - If you are considering this option for your Starlink Kit order, before cancelling, we recommend confirming that you can purchase another kit at the desired location to confirm current availability at that service address and avoid losing your spot.
Shipping address restrictions
  * Shipping your items to a country different than the service address used at sign up is not supported. This applies to all Starlink service plans. This requires an account created in the desired country.
  * Shipping address requirements vary by region. 
  * Some carriers can't deliver to certain address types (ie P.O. Boxes are not supported in some countries)
