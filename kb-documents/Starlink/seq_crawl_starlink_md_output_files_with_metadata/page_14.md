### How do I add a user (contact) to my account?
Log in to your Starlink [account](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/www.starlink.com/account/home>) in order to add an additional user (contact) on your account:
  1. From your account home page, navigate to the "Settings" page
  2. Select "Add User"
  3. Enter the contacts email, first name, last name, and phone number
  4. Select "Add User" to save contact


We also offer role based access controls for Starlink Business customers, please reference "[Do you offer role based access control?](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=4c00bc5d-558b-f6ef-76fe-928e19cdb10c>)" and "[How do I assign roles to users on my account?](https://www.starlink.com/support/article/<https:/support.starlink.com/?topic=6f59e2d9-fcc0-3487-4e08-71070a888527>)" for instructions on how to use this feature. You may consider adding another contact to your Starlink account so that a family member or next of kin may access your account in the event of your death. This person will also have access to your account when you are alive. 
**Limitation** : Maximum number of user contacts per account, including account owners contact information:
  * Residential accounts: 3
  * Business accounts: 500
  * Enterprise (managed business) accounts: 1500


Once you have reached the maximum number of users for your account, you will see a message stating "You have reached the max allowed users on your account".
