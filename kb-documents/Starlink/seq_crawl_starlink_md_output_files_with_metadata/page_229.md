### How do I upgrade to Starlink Business?
Place a new Business order from <https://www.starlink.com/business> using the same email address you used for your current Starlink account. Our systems will recognize your email address and allow you to switch between accounts once you sign in.
If you wish to transfer an existing device to a Business account, you must first complete the steps to transfer the device, then follow the steps to activate the device on new business account <https://www.starlink.com/activate>.
